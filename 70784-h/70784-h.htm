CONSIDERED.</h2>
</div>


<p>There are several proposals offer’d
to remedy the difficulties
the nation is under from the great
scarcity of money.</p>

<p>That a right judgment may be
made, which will be most safe, advantageous
and practicable; it seems
necessary, 1. that the nature of
money be inquired into, and why
silver was used as money preferable
to other goods. 2. that trade be
considered, and how far money affects
trade. 3. that the measures have
been used for preserving and increasing
money, and these now proposed,
be examined.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>How goods are valued. of barter. of silver; its value
as a metal; its qualities fitting it for money; and of
the additional value it received from being used as
money.</i></p>
</div>


<p>Goods have a value from the uses
they are applyed to; and their value
is greater or lesser, not so much from
their more or less valuable, or necessary
uses, as from the greater or lesser
quantity of them in proportion to the
demand for them. example; water is
of great use, yet of little value; because
the quantity of water is much
greater than the demand for it. diamonds
are of little use, yet of great
value, because the demand for diamonds
is much greater, than the
quantity of them.</p>

<p>Goods of the same kind differ in
value, from any difference in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
quality, one horse is better than another
horse. barley of one country
is better than barley of another
country.</p>

<p>Goods change their value, from any
change in their quantity, or in the
demand for them. if oats be in
greater quantity than last year, and
the demand the same, or lesser, oats
will be less valuable.</p>

<p>Mr. Locke says, the value of goods
is according to their quantity in proportion
to their vent. the vent of
goods cannot be greater than the
quantity, but the demand may be
greater: if the quantity of wine
brought from France be a 100 ton,
and the demand be for 500 ton, the
demand is greater than the vent; and
the 100 ton will sell at a higher price,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
than if the demand were only equal
to the vent. so the prices of goods are
not according to the quantity in proportion
to the vent, but in proportion
to the demand.</p>

<p>Before the use of money was
known, goods were exchanged by
barter, or contract; and contracts were
made payable in goods.</p>

<p>This state of barter was inconvenient,
and disadvantageous. 1. he
who desired to barter would not always
find people who wanted the
goods he had, and had such goods as
he desired in exchange.</p>

<p>2. Contracts taken payable in
goods were uncertain, for goods of
the same kind differed in value.</p>

<p>3. There was no measure by
which the proportion of value goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
had to one another could be known.</p>

<p>In this state of barter there was
little trade, and few arts-men. the
people depended on the landed-men.
the landed-men laboured only so
much of the land as served the occasions
of their families, to barter for
such necessaries as their land did not
produce; and to lay up for seed and
bad years. what remained was unlaboured;
or gifted on condition of
vassalage, and other services.</p>

<p>The losses and difficulties that
attended barter, would force the landed-men
to a greater consumption of
the goods of their own product, and a
lesser consumption of other goods; or
to supply themselves, they would turn
the land to the product of the several
goods they had occasion for; tho’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
only proper to produce of one kind.
so, much of the land was unlaboured,
what was laboured was not employ’d
to that by which it would have turned
to most advantage, nor the people to
the labour they were most fit for.</p>

<p>Silver as a metal had a value in
barter, as other goods; from the uses
it was then apply’d to.</p>

<p>As goods of the same kind differ’d
in value, so silver differ’d from silver,
as it was more or less fine.</p>

<p>Silver was lyable to a change in its
value, as other goods, from any
change in its quantity, or in the demand
for it.</p>

<p>Silver had qualities which fitted it
for the use of money.</p>

<p>1. It could be brought to a standard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
in fineness, so was certain as to its
quality.</p>

<p>2. It was easie of delivery.</p>

<p>3. It was of the same value in one
place that it was in another; or differed
little, being easie of carriage.</p>

<p>4. It could be kept without loss
or expence; taking up little room,
and being durable.</p>

<p>5. It could be divided without
loss, an ounce in four pieces, being
equal in value to an ounce in one
piece.</p>

<p>Silver having these qualities, ’tis
reasonable to think it was used as
money, before it was coined. what
is meant by being used as money,
is, that silver in bullion was the measure
by which goods were valued: the
value by which goods were exchanged:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and in which contracts were made
payable.</p>

<p>He who had more goods than he
had use for, would choose to barter
them for silver, tho’ he had no use for
it; because, silver was certain in it’s
quality: it was easie of delivery: it
could be kept without loss or expence:
and with it he could purchase other
goods as he had occasion, in whole
or in part, at home or abroad, silver
being divisible without loss, and of
the same value in different places.
If A. B. had 100 sheep, and desired
to exchange them for horses;
C. D. had 10 horses, which were
equal to, or worth the 100 sheep, and
was willing to exchange: but as A.
B. had not present occasion for the
horses, rather than be at the expence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of keeping them, he would barter
his sheep with E. F. who had the
value to give in silver, with which he
could purchase the horses at the time
he had occasion.</p>

<p>Or if E. F. had not silver, but
was satisfied to give his bond for the
silver, or the horses, payable at the
time A. B. wanted them; A. B.
would choose to take the bond payable
in silver, rather than in horses:
because silver was certain in quality,
and horses differed much. so silver
was used as the value in which contracts
were made payable.</p>

<p>Silver was likewise used as the
measure by which goods were valued,
because certain in quality. if A.
B. had a 100 weight of lead, and desired
to exchange it for barley, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
way to know what quantity of barley
was equal in value to the lead, was by
the silver. if the 100 weight of lead
was equal to five ounces of fine silver,
and 5 ounces of fine silver equal to 20
bolls of barley, then 20 bolls was
the quantity of barley to be given in
exchange for the lead.</p>

<p>Silver being easie of carriage, so
equal in one place to what it was in
another; was used as the measure
by which goods to be delivered in
different places were valued. If a
piece of wine was to be delivered at
Glasgow by A. B. merchant there,
to the order of C. D. merchant in
Aberdeen: and the value to be delivered
in oats at Aberdeen by C. D. to
the order of A. B. the wine could
not be valued by the quantity of oats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
it was worth at Glasgow, nor the oats
by the quantity of wine they were
worth at Aberdeen. wine or oats
might differ in quality, or be more or
less valuable at the one place than at
the other. the way to have known
what quantity of oats was equal to the
wine, was by the quantity of silver
each was worth at the places they
were to be delivered. if the piece of
wine was worth at Glasgow 20 ounces
of fine silver, and 20 ounces of fine
silver worth 50 bolls of oats at Aberdeen;
then 50 bolls was the quantity
of oats to be given there in return for
the wine.</p>

<p>Silver being capable of a stamp,
princes, for the greater convenience
of the people, set up mints to bring it
to a standard, and stamp it; whereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
its weight and fineness was known,
without the trouble of weighing or
fyning; but the stamp added nothing
to the value.</p>

<p>For these reasons silver was used as
money; its being coined was only a
consequence of its being applied to
that use in bullion, tho’ not with the
same convenience.</p>

<p>Mr. Locke and others who have
wrote on this subject, say, the general
consent of men placed an imaginary
value upon silver, because of its
qualities fitting it for money.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Locke p. 31. upon interest, and p. 1. upon money.</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot conceive how different
nations could agree to put an imaginary
value upon any thing, especially
upon silver, by which all other goods
are valued; or that any one country
would receive that as a value, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
was not valuable equal to what it was
given for; or how that imaginary value
could have been kept up. but,
suppose France receiving silver at an
imaginary value, other nations received
it at that value, because received so
in France: then for the same reason
a crown passing in France for 76 Sols,
should pass in Scotland for 76 pence,
and in Holland for 76 Stivers. but
on the contrair, even in France
where the crown is raised, ’tis worth
no more than before when at 60 Sols.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to think silver was
barter’d as it was valued for its uses as
a mettal, and was given as money according
to its value in barter. the
additional use of money silver was
applied to would add to its value, because
as money it remedied the disadvantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and inconveniencies of
barter, and consequently the demand
for silver increasing, it received an
additional value equal to the greater
demand its use as money occasioned.</p>

<p>And this additional value is no
more imaginary, than the value silver
had in barter as a metal, for such
value was because it served such
uses, and was greater or lesser according
to the demand for silver as a
mettal, proportioned to its quantity.
the additional value silver received
from being used as money, was because
of its qualities which fitted it for
that use; and that value was according
to the additional demand its use as
money occasioned.</p>

<p>If either of these values are imaginary,
then all value is so, for no goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
have any value, but from the uses
they are apply’d to, and according
to the demand for them, in proportion
to their quantity.</p>

<p>Thus silver having a value, and
qualities fitting it for money, which
other goods had not, was made money,
and for the greater convenience of
the people was coined.</p>

<p>The names of the different pieces
might have been number 1. number
2. and so on; number 60 would
have been the same as a crown; for
the name and stamp was only to certify,
that the piece had such a quantity
of silver in it, of such a fineness.</p>

<p>Goods of any other kind that
have the same qualities might then,
and may now be made money equal
to their value. gold and copper may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
be made money, but neither with so
much convenience as silver. payments
in copper being inconvenient
by reason of its bulk; and gold not
being in so great quantity as to serve
the use of money. in countries where
gold is in great quantity, it is used as
money; and where gold and silver
are scarce, copper is used.</p>

<p>Gold is coined for the more easie
exchange of that metal, and copper
to serve in small payments; but silver
is the measure by which goods are
valued, the value by which goods are
exchanged, and in which contracts
are made payable.</p>

<p>As money encreased, the disadvantages
and inconveniences of barter
were removed; the poor and idle were
employed, more of the land was laboured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the product encreased, manufactures
and trade improved, the
landed-men lived better, and the people
with less dependance on them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Of Trade, and how far it depends on money. that the
increase of the people depends on Trade. of exchange.</i></p>
</div>


<p>Trade is domestick, or foreign.
domestick trade is the imployment of
the people, and the exchange of goods
within the country.</p>

<p>Foreign trade has several branches.</p>

<p>1. The product and manufacture
being more than the consumption, a
part is exported, and in return foreign
goods are brought home.</p>

<p>2. Selling the goods exported at one
port, and loading there to sell another;
whereby a greater return is made,
than if the goods exported had been
carry’d directly there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>3. Bringing home the product and
manufacture of other countries, from
whence, and when they are cheap;
to supply countries where, and when
they are dear.</p>

<p>4. Bringing home the product of
other countries, and exporting it in
manufacture.</p>

<p>5. Freighting, or hireing out ships.</p>

<p>Domestick and foreign trade may
be carried on by barter; but not for
so great a value as by money, nor
with so much convenience.</p>

<p>Domestick trade depends on the
money. a greater quantity employs
more people than a lesser quantity.
a limited sum can only set a number
of people to work proportioned to
it, and ’tis with little success laws are
made, for imploying the poor or idle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
in countries where money is scarce;
good laws may bring the money to
the full circulation ’tis capable of, and
force it to those employments that
are most profitable to the country:
but no laws can make it go further,
nor can more people be set to work,
without more money to circulate so,
as to pay the wages of a greater number.
they may be brought to work
on credit, and that is not practicable,
unless the credit have a circulation, so
as to supply the workman with necessaries;
if that’s supposed, then that
credit is money, and will have the
same effects, on home, and foreign
trade.</p>

<p>An addition to the money adds
to the value of the country. so long
as money gives interest, it is imployed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and money imployed brings profit,
tho’ the imployer loses. if 50
men are set to work, to whom 25
shillings is payed per day, and the
improvement made by their labour be
only equal to, or worth 15 s. yet by
so much the value of the country is
increased. but as it is reasonable to
suppose their labour equal to 40. s. so
much is added to the value of the
country, of which the imployer gains
15 s. 15 may be supposed to equal
the consumption of the labourers,
who before lived on charity, and 10 s.
remains to them over their consumption.</p>

<p>If a stone of wooll is worth 10 s.
and made into cloth worth 2 pound;
the product is improved to four times
the value it had in wooll: the workmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
may be supposed to consume
more than when they were not imployed;
allow one 4th, the nation is
gainer double the value of the product.
so an addition to the money,
whether the imployer gains or not,
adds to the national wealth, eases the
country of a number of poor or idle,
proportioned to the money added,
enables them to live better, and to
bear a share in the publick with the
other people.</p>

<p>The first branch of foreign trade,
which is the export and import of
goods, depends on the money. if one
half of the people are imployed, and
the whole product and manufacture
consumed; more money, by imploying
more people, will make an overplus
to export: if then the goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
imported ballance the goods exported,
a greater addition to the money will
imploy yet more people, or the same
people before employed to more advantage;
which by making a greater,
or more valuable export, will make
a ballance due. so if the money lessens,
a part of the people then imployed
are set idle, or imployed to less advantage;
the product and manufacture
is less, or less valuable, the export of
consequence less, and a ballance due
to foreigners.</p>

<p>The 2d and 3d branches of foreign
trade, called the trades of carriage;
are monopolized out of Europe,
by these countries who have
colonies; and in Europe, by these
who sell cheapest.</p>

<p>Scotland has advantages for trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
by which the merchants might undersell
merchants in Holland, as
cheapness of living, paying less to the
publick, having workmen, seamen,
and provisions for victualling cheaper:
but if the Dutch merchant’s stock is
10000 lib. and his yearly expence
500; he can trade at 10 per cent profit,
and add yearly 500 lib. to his stock.
whereas a Scots merchant, whose
stock is 500 lib. and his yearly expence
50; cannot trade so cheap.</p>

<p>If ’tis ask’t how a Dutch merchant
trades who has only 500 lib. stock?
he restricts his expence so as he can
afford to trade at 10 per cent profit:
or money being in greater quantity
in Holland, whereby it is easier borrowed,
and at less use; he gets credit
for more at 3 or 4 per cent, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
he gains 6 or 7. and unless money
be in greater quantity in Scotland, or
expence retrench’d, we cannot trade
so cheap as the Dutch; tho’ we have
advantages for trade that they have
not, and tho’ they be under disadvantages
we are not lyable to. by a greater
quantity of money and oeconomy,
the Dutch monopolize the trades of
carriage even from the English.</p>

<p>The 4th branch of foreign trade,
bringing home the product of other
countries, and exporting it in manufacture,
depends on the quantity of
money. we are so far from competing
with the Dutch in this trade, that
our wooll was sent to Holland, and
imported from thence in manufacture;
under the difficulty of a prohibition
on the export of the wooll, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the import of the manufacture. yet
besides the advantages already named,
which we have for trade over the
Dutch, the material is the product of
our country, and greater privileges are
granted to manufacturers here, than
in Holland.</p>

<p>’Tis alledged, if the prohibition
had continued, manufactures might
have come to perfection.</p>

<p>The advantage some men made by
manufacture, may have occasion’d the
setting up of more, while the money
has been diminishing; but that money
so imployed, has been taken from
some other use it was before imploy’d
in: for money cannot serve in two
places at one time.</p>

<p>’Tis alledged, that the allowing
the wooll to be exported, occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the exportation of the money. that at
one time 5000 lib. was sent to England
to buy wooll. ’tis askt what became
of that wooll? they answer, it
was sent to France for wine. then, as
5000 lib. of English wooll may be
worth 8 or 10 thousand pound in
France; so the 5000 lib. sent to England,
saved the sending out of 8 or
10000 lib. to France.</p>

<p>To those who don’t throughly examine
the state of this country, it may
seem odd that wooll should be allowed
by law to be exported: but if the
product of Scotland cannot be manufactur’d
with less than 50000 people,
and the money that can be spar’d
to manufacture, be only capable to
employ 25000, one half of the product
will be lost if it is not allowed to
be exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The 5th branch, the freighting or
hireing out ships, depends on the
money, and the other branches of
trade. where ships are in use to be
freighted by strangers, and supported
by a great demand for their own
trade; there all sorts of ships are to
be hired cheaper than in other places;
and merchants are sure of such ships
as are proper for the goods they load
with, and the countries they trade to.</p>

<p>This trade of freighting brings the
goods of other countries to Holland,
tho’ design’d for sale elsewhere. if
woollen manufacture from England
to Portugal yields 25 per cent profit,
and to Holland 15; the English merchant
will choose to fend such goods
to Holland for 15 per cent, rather
than to Portugal for 25; and the Dutch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
merchant who is able to trade cheaper,
from the cheapness of freight, etc. is
satisfied for the other 10 to carry to
Portugal.</p>

<p>Most authors who have wrote on
trade divide it into national and private.
they say, a merchant may gain
where the nation loses. if a 1000 lib.
is exported to the Indies in money or
bullion, and a 1000 lib. in goods or
provisions; the return worth 8000 lib.
the merchant gains 6000; but as these
goods are all consumed in the country,
the nation loses the 1000 lib.
money or bullion exported.</p>

<p>They don’t consider whether the
8000 lib. of goods imported (all supposed
to be consum’d in the country)
does not lessen the consumption of
the product or manufacture of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
country, so as to occasion an addition
to the export, at least equal to the
1000 lib. money or bullion exported.
but allowing they do not lessen the
consumption of the goods of the
country, and the use of them be not
at all necessary; yet these goods being
worth 8000 lib. at home or abroad,
the nation gains 6000. if the people
consume them, and in extravagant
uses, that’s not the fault of the trade,
nor for that reason should that trade be
call’d disadvantageous; it is the fault
of the government, who ought to hinder
the too great consumption of foreign
goods; especially, such as might
be wanted without causing a greater
consumption of the goods of the country,
that care being taken, by making
the vent less profitable at home, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
abroad; merchants would export
them, or for the future lessen the
import.</p>

<p>If East-India goods that sell for a
1000 lib. in England, are only worth
abroad 800 lib, the duty payed at their
entry being return’d, and more given
as a draw-back to encourage the export,
their vent abroad will be more
profitable than in England.</p>

<p>A people may consume more of
their own or foreign goods, than the
value of the product, manufacture, and
profits by trade; but their trade is not
disadvantageous, it is their too great
consumption: and the too great consumption
of the product and manufacture
of the country, may be as
hurtful as that of foreign goods; for,
if so much is consumed, that the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
exported won’t pay the consumption
of foreign goods, a ballance
will be due, and that ballance
will be sent out in money or bullion.</p>

<p>A nation may gain where the merchant
loses, but wherever the merchant
gains, the nation gains equal,
and so much more, as the maintenance
and wages of the people employ’d
and the duty on the goods amounts
to. if a ship insur’d is lost,
the nation loses, and the merchant
loses nothing; but in that case the insurer
is the merchant, and loses equal
to the nation.</p>

<p>As trade depends on money, so
the encrease or decrease of the people
depends on trade. if they have employment
at home, they are kept at
home: and if the trade is greater than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
serves to employ the people, it brings
more from places where they are not
employ’d. Sir William Petty values a
man at 20 years purchase, by that
computation a seaman whose wages
is forty shil. a month, is valued 480
lib.</p>

<p>Scotland has a very inconsiderable
trade, because she has but a very small
part of the money. there is a little
home trade, but the country is not
improv’d, nor the product manufactur’d.
there is a little of the first
branch of foreign trade, and that is
carried on with great disadvantage to
the people, who pay dearer for most
foreign goods, and are worse serv’d,
than other nations: if they have any
cheaper, ’tis from the lower duty on
the import. in Scotland low prices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
are given for goods bought up to be
exported, the merchants profit being
great: if a 100 stone of wooll is worth
in Holland ten piece of linen cloth,
these ten pieces are sold in Scotland
for the value of a 180 or 200 stone
of such wooll. such goods as do not
yield that great profit, are not exported;
and these that do, are not exported
in any quantity, the merchant’s
stock being small. Scotland has no
part of the other branches of foreign
trade, not being able to trade so cheap
as other nations.</p>

<p>Some think if interest were lower’d
by law, trade would increase, merchants
being able to employ more
money and trade cheaper. such a law
would have many inconveniencies,
and it is much to be doubted, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
it would have any good effect;
indeed, if lowness of interest were the
consequence of a greater quantity of
money, the stock apply’d to trade
would be greater, and merchants
would trade cheaper, from the easiness
of borrowing and the lower interest
of money, without any inconveniencies
attending it.</p>

<p>Tho’ interest were at 3 per cent in
Holland, and continued at 6 in Scotland;
if money were to be had equal
to the demands at 6, the advantages
we have for trade, which the Dutch
have not, would enable us to extend
trade to its other branches, notwithstanding
the difference of interest.</p>

<p>If money in Scotland were equal
to the demands at 6 per cent, the
Dutch could not trade so cheap in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
herring; the hinderances of that
trade being the consequences of the
scarcity of money. the materials for
carrying on the fishing are cheaper in
Holland, but the cheapness of victualling
alone would ballance that. and
the dearth of these materials, as of other
foreign goods, coming from the
scarcity of money; that being remeded,
these materials, and other foreign
goods that are not the product of Holland,
would be sold as cheap in Scotland.</p>

<p>Exchange, is when a merchant
exports to a greater value than he
imports, and has money due abroad;
another importing to a greater value
than he exported, has occasion for
money abroad: this last by paying in
money to the other, of the weight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
fineness with that is due him, or to
that value, saves the trouble, hazard,
and expence, to himself of sending
money out, to the other of bringing
money home, and to both the expence
of re-coyning.</p>

<p>So long as foreign trade, and expence
kept equal, exchange was at the
par: but when a people imported for
a greater value, or had other occasions
abroad, more than their export, and
the expence of foreigners among them
would ballance; there was a necessity
of sending out the ballance in money
or bullion, and the merchant or gentleman
who owed, or had occasion for
money abroad, to save the trouble,
expence and hazard of sending it out,
gave so much per cent to another, as
the trouble, expence and hazard was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
valued at. thus exchange rose above
the par, and became a trade.</p>

<p>Mr. Mun on trade, page 100,
says, the exchange being against a nation,
is of advantage to that nation.
and supposes, if a 100 lib. at London
is worth no more than 90 lib. of the
same money at Amsterdam, the Dutch
to send 500000 lib. of goods to England,
and the English 400000 lib. of
goods to Holland; it follows, that
the money due the English at Amsterdam,
will ballance 440000 lib. due
to the Dutch at London: so 60000
lib. pays the ballance. Mr. Mun does
not consider, that the Dutch goods
worth 500000 lib. when exchange
was at the par, are worth at London
555555 l. when 90 lib. at Amsterdam
is worth a 100 lib. at London.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and the 400000 lib. of English goods
in Holland, are only worth 360000
lib. that sum being equal by exchange
to 400000 lib. in England. so in place
of England’s having an advantage of
40000 lib. as he alledges by the exchange
being against her: she pays
95555 lib. more, than if exchange had
been at the par.</p>

<p>When exchange is above the par,
it is not only payed for the sums due
of ballance, but affects the whole exchange
to the place where the ballance
is due. if the ballance is 20000
lib. and the sums exchanged by merchants
who have money abroad, with
others who are owing, or have occasion
for money there, be 60000 lib.
the bills for the 60000 lib. are sold
at or near the same price, with the
20000 lib. of ballance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>It likewise affects the exchange to
countries where no ballance is due.
if the exchange betwixt Scotland and
Holland is 3 per cent. above the
par against Scotland, betwixt England
and Holland at the par, tho’ no
ballance is due by Scotland to England,
yet the exchange with England
will rise; for, a 100 lib. in England
remitted to Scotland by Holland, will
yield 103 lib. so betwixt Scotland and
England it may be supposed to be had
at 2 per cent, being less trouble than
to remit by Holland.</p>

<p>Goods are sold to foreigners, according
to the first cost. if goods
worth a 100 lib. in Scotland, are
worth 130 lib. in England, these
goods will be exported, 30 per cent
being supposed enough for the charges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and profit. if the price of these goods
lower in Scotland from a 100 lib. to
80, the price in England will not continue
at a 130; it will lower proportionably,
for either Scots merchants
will undersell one another, or English
merchants will export these goods
themselves. so if they rise in Scotland
from a 100 lib. to 120; they will rise
proportionably in England, unless
the English can be served with these
goods cheaper from other places, or
can supply the use of them with goods
of another kind. this being supposed,
it follows that,</p>

<p>By so much as exchange is above
the par, so much all goods exported
are sold cheaper, and all goods imported
are sold dearer than before. if a
merchant send goods yearly to England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
first cost, charges and profit 6000
lib. money in England of the same
standard with money in Scotland,
and no ballance due; but a ballance
due to Holland, raising the exchange
3 per cent above the par to Holland,
and affecting the exchange to England
2 per cent, 5882 lib. 7 sh. in
England pays the goods, that sum by
exchange being equal to 6000 lib. in
Scotland. so that a ballance due to Holland,
by raising the exchange to other
countries, occasions a loss to Scotland
of 117 lib. 13 sh. on the value of
6000 lib. of goods sent to England.</p>

<p>English goods are sold so much
dearer. if an English merchant sends
goods yearly to Scotland, first cost,
charges and profit 6000 lib. 6120 lib.
must be payed for these goods in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Scotland, being only equal to 6000
lib. in England. if the exchange had
been at the par, the Scots goods sent
to England would have sold 117 lib.
14 sh. more, and the English goods
sent to Scotland 120 lib. less.</p>

<p>Thus to all places with whom
exchange is above the par, goods sent
out are sold so much less, and goods
brought from thence are sold so much
dearer, as the exchange is above the
par; whether sent out, or brought in,
by Scots or foreign merchants.</p>

<p>The merchant who deals in English
goods gains no more than when
exchange was at the par, tho’ he sells
dearer; nor the merchant who deals
in Scots goods less, tho’ he sells cheaper;
they have both the same profit
as when exchange was at the par.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Scotland pays 2 per cent more for
English goods, and England 2 per
cent less for Scots goods: all, or a
great part of the loss falls at last on
the landed man in Scotland, and it is
the landed man in England has all,
or a great part of the benefit.</p>

<p>Nations finding the export of money
or bullion to pay the ballance due
by trade, a loss of so much riches, and
very hurtful to trade, might have discharged
the import of such goods as
the people could best want; or laid a
duty on them, such as might have
lessen’d their consumption: they might
have given encouragement to industry,
whereby the product would have been
encreas’d and improv’d, or discouraged
extravagant consumption, whereby
the overplus to export would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
been greater; any one of these methods
would have brought trade and
exchange equal, and have made a ballance
due them: but in place of these
measures, they prohibit bullion and
money to be exported, which could
not well have any other effect, than
to raise the exchange equal to the hazard,
such laws added to the export
of money or bullion, which may be
supposed 3 per cent more: and as these
laws by such effect were hurtful, making
all goods exported sell yet 3 per
cent cheaper, and all goods imported 3
per cent dearer; the stricter they were
execute, the higher the exchange rose,
and the more they did hurt. the ballance
was still sent out in money or bullion,
by the merchant who owed it, by
the banker who gave the bills, or by
the foreigner to whom it was due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Suppose the money of Scotland,
England, and Holland of the same
weight and fineness. Scotland to trade
with no other places. the exchange
at the par. the yearly export from
Scotland, first cost 300000 lib. charges

<p>The expense of Scots-men abroad,
more than of foreigners in Scotland,
40000 lib. if this is supposed the yearly
state of the trade and expense of
Scotland, there will be a ballance due
of 17000 lib. and unless the Scots
retrench the consumption of foreign
goods, so as to import less; or retrench
the consumption of their own goods,
so as to export more; or increase, or
improve their product, so as the export
be greater or more valuable; or
retrench in their expence abroad. since
that ballance must be paid it will go
out in money or bullion: and occasions
the exchange to rise 3 per cent,
the prohibition on the export of money
3 more, if Scots-men export it,
the Nation saves the 1020 l. exchange
on the 170000 of ballance due, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
is lost if English merchants export
it; but the loss such a rise in exchange
occasions on the goods, is more considerable.
the 195000 lib. due abroad
for goods sent out of Scotland by
Scots merchants, will be payed with
183962 lib. English or Dutch money,
that sum being equal by exchange at
6 per cent to 195000 lib. in Scotland.
the 150000 lib. due for first
cost of goods carried out by English
or Dutch merchants, will be payed
with 141510 lib. English or Dutch
money, that sum being equal to
150000 lib. in Scotland. the 182000
lib. due by Scotland for goods imported
by English and Dutch merchants,
will come to 192920 lib. in Scotland.
and the 140000 lib. first cost of goods
brought home by Scots merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
will come to 148400 lib. in Scotland.
so the accompt will run thus.</p>

<p>So the rise in the exchange of 3 per
cent by the ballance due of 17000 lib.
and 3 more by the prohibition on
the export of money, occasions a loss
to Scotland of 21721 l. and makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the next year’s ballance 38721 lib.
tho’ the trade be the same as before.
of which 21721 lib. lost by exchange,
one half would be saved if money
were allowed to be exported.</p>

<p>Since the exchange being 6 per cent
above the par, occasions the loss of
21721 lib. then raising the money 8
and a one third per cent, having raised
the exchange with England to 14
per cent, and with Holland to 30,
makes the loss proportionably greater:
Scots goods being supposed to continue
at the same prices they were sold
for, before the money was raised, or
not to rise in the same proportion
with the money. for when exchange
was at the par, a 100 lib. of Scots
goods were sold abroad for a 130 lib.
English money; but 114 lib. English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
money, being now equal by exchange
to a 130 lib. in Scotland, the Scots
merchant can afford to sell the same
quantity of goods for a 114 lib. that
he sold before at a 130, and have the
same profit. so foreign goods worth
abroad a 100 lib. and sold in Scotland
for a 130 lib. when exchange
was at the par; cannot be sold now
for less than a 150 lib. in Scotland, that
sum being only equal to a 130 lib.
English money; and the merchant’s
profit is no greater, than when he
sold the same quantity of goods for
a 130 lib.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to consider
what consequences would attend
the lowering the money to the English
standard, and allowing it to be
exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>The former state of trade I have
supposed to be carried on, one half
by Scots merchants, the other half
by English and Dutch; but as most
of the trade is carried on by Scots
merchants, I shall suppose this state
of trade accordingly. the one or the
other will clear the matter in question.</p>

<p>The state of trade now, and exchange
supposed at 15 per cent to England,
and 30 to Holland. the whole
export of Scotland to be 300000 lib.
of which 250000 lib. carried out by
Scots merchants, sold at 30 per cent
profit and charges 325000 lib.</p>

alteration in the exchange, lowering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the value of foreign money; might
hinder the sale of our goods abroad.
for, linen-cloth bought in Scotland
for a 100 lib. and sold at London for
a 115 lib. yields by exchange 31 per
cent profit. but if exchange were 6 per
cent on the Scots side, the profit is
only 9 per cent.</p>

<p>It is answered. if an English merchant
takes bills on Scotland for a
1000 lib. to lay out on linen-cloth, the
exchange then at the par: the linen-cloth
is sold in England according to
the first cost, charges and usual profit.
next year the exchange is on the English
side, the linen is sold in England
cheaper than before. the third year
exchange returns to the par, the linen
is then sold in England as the first
year. if the first cost of linen is dearer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the consumer pays the more for it,
the merchant’s profit is the same.</p>

<p>All nations endeavour to get the exchange
as much as they can on their
side. the exchange from Holland to
England is 12 or 15 per cent, to Scotland
30 per cent, to France 40 or 50,
sometimes more; yet Dutch goods
sell in these countries, the merchant
has his profit the same as when exchange
was lower, the consumer pays
more for them. English cloth is sold
at Paris from 18 to 20 livres the
French ell. when the lued’ore is at
12 livres, from 20 to 23, when the
lued’ore is at 14 livres: because the
exchange to England is dearer, in proportion
as the French money is rais’d.</p>

<p>Most goods sent from Scotland are
such as foreigners won’t want, tho’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
they payed 10 or 20 per cent more
for them. we have an example of
this in the wooll. during the prohibition,
wooll sold in Holland and
France for double the first cost, now
it has fallen to 30 or 40 per cent
profit. prices are given for goods, according
to their first cost, charges, and
usual profit; where prohibitions are,
the hazard of exporting contrair to
law is valued. wooll is of less value
now in Holland than in time of peace,
because the vent of their woollen manufacture
is less; but tho’ wooll were
as valuable in Holland as before, and
tho’ a Dutch manufacturer would give
200 lib. for wooll that cost only a
100 lib. in Scotland, rather than want
it: yet as he knows the prohibition is
taken off, and that the Scots merchants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
can afford to sell cheaper; he won’t
buy unless he can have it at a reasonable
profit. so either the Scots merchants
bring down the price, by under-selling
one another; or the Dutch
merchant commissions it himself. if
a duty were put on such goods whose
value abroad would bear it, the merchant
would gain the same, ’tis the
foreigner pays the duty.</p>

<p>Besides, lowering the money may
not lower the prices abroad. for, as
when money was raised, goods may
have rose in proportion, or have been
made worse; so as a 100 lib. after the
money is lower’d will have 33 crowns
and 1/8 more silver in it, than a 100 lib.
had before; so a greater quantity of
goods may be bought with a 100
lib. than before, or the goods may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
be made better: especially the linen-cloth,
since the material would be
imported for less. but, allowing that
upon the lowering the money, goods
sold in Scotland as before, and were
made no better; and allowing that
one third or more of the goods exported,
could not be raised in their
prices abroad; because foreigners
might be served cheaper with the same
kind of goods from other places, or
might supply the use of them with
goods of another kind; or might consume
less of them; yet, that ought
not to hinder such a regulation of the
money and exchange; for a draw-back
might be given upon the export
of such goods, whose prices abroad
were not great enough to yield a reasonable
profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>But lest such an alteration in the
exchange, or undervaluing foreign
money, should lessen the export of
goods: it may not be adviseable, unless
a fund were given, out of which
draw-backs might be payed to encourage
export, and an addition be made
to the money, whereby the people
may be set to work. for without some
addition to the money, ’tis not to be
supposed next year’s export can be equal
to the last: it will lessen as money
has lessened; a part of the people then
imployed being now idle; not for
want of inclination to work, or for
want of imployers, but for want of
money to imploy them with.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Of the different measures which have been used to preserve
and increase money. and of banks.</i></p>
</div>


<p>The measures have been used to
preserve and increase money, have
in some countries been opposite to
what has been used in others: and opposite
measures have been used in the
same countries, without any differing
circumstances to occasion them.</p>

<p>Some countries have raised money
in the denomination, when others
have lowered it; some have allay’d it,
when others who had allay’d it have
rectified it; some have prohibited the
export of money under severest penalties,
when others have by law allowed
it to be exported; some thinking to
add to the money, have obliged traders
to bring home bullion, in proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to the goods they imported.
most countries have tryed some or
all of these measures, and others of
the same nature, and have tryed contrary
measures at one time, from what
they used immediately before, from
the opinion, that since the method
used had not the effect designed, a contrary
would: yet it has not been found,
that any of them have preserved or
increased money; but on the contrair.</p>

<p>The use of banks has been the
best method yet practised for the increase
of money. banks have been
long used in Italy, but as I am informed,
the invention of them was owing to
Sweedland. their money was copper,
which was inconvenient, by reason
of its weight and bulk; to remedy
this inconveniency, a bank was set up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
where the money might be pledged,
and credit given to the value, which
past in payments, and facilitate trade.</p>

<p>The Dutch for the same reason set
up the bank of Amsterdam. their
money was silver, but their trade was
so great as to find payments even in
silver inconvenient. this bank like
that of Sweedland, is a secure place,
where merchants may give in money,
and have credit to trade with.
besides the convenience of easier and
quicker payments, these banks save
the expence of casheers, the expence
of bags and carriage, losses by bad money,
and the money is safer than in
the merchants houses, for ’tis less lyable
to fire or robbery, the necessary
measures being taken to prevent them.</p>

<p>Merchants who have money in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the bank of Amsterdam, and people
of other countries who deal with
them, are not lyable to the changes in
the money, by its being allay’d or altered
in the denomination: for, the
bank receives no money but what’s of
value, and is therefore called bank-money;
and tho’ raised in current
payments, it goes for the value it was
pledged for in bank-payments. the
<span class="smcap">ag o</span> of the bank changes a quarter
or a half p. cent, as current money is
more or less scarce.</p>

<p>Banks where the money is pledg’d
equal to the credit given, are sure;
for, tho’ demands are made of the
whole, the bank does not fail in payment.</p>

<p>By the constitution of this bank, the
whole sum for which credit is given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
ought to remain there, to be ready at
demand; yet a sum is lent by the managers
for a stock to the lumbar, and
’tis thought they lend great sums on
other occasions. so far as they lend
they add to the money, which brings
a profit to the country, by imploying
more people, and extending trade;
they add to the money to be lent,
whereby it is easier borrowed, and at
less use; and the bank has a benefit:
but the bank is less sure, and tho’ none
suffer by it, or are apprehensive of
danger, its credit being good; yet if
the whole demands were made, or
demands greater than the remaining
money, they could not all be satisfied,
till the bank had called in what sums
were lent.</p>

<p>The certain good it does, will more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
than ballance the hazard, tho’ once in
two or three years it failed in payment;
providing the sums lent be well
secured: merchants who had money
there, might be disappointed of it at
demand, but the security being good,
and interest allowed; money would be
had on a small discount, perhaps at
the par.</p>

<p>Last war, England set up a bank
to have the conveniencies of that at
Amsterdam, and by their constitution
to increase money. this bank
was made up of subscribers, who lent
the King 1200000 lib. at 8 and a
third per cent, for 11 years, on a parliamentary
fund; and were priviledged
bankers for that time. the sum due
by the government was a security to
the people, to make good any losses
the bank might suffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>This bank was safer than the gold-smiths
notes in use before. it made a
great addition to the money, having
a much greater sum of notes out, than
money in bank. and the sum lent the
King, which was the fund belonged to
the subscribers, was negotiated at profit,
and had the same effect in trade as
money. I don’t know how their notes
came to be at discount, whether from
the circumstances of the nation, or
from ill management.</p>

<p>The fund of the bank of Scotland
was a 100000 l. of which a tenth
was payed in. this bank was safer than
that of England, there being a register
whereby most sums lent were secured.
its notes went for 4 or 5 times
the value of the money in bank, and
by so much as these notes went for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
more than the money in bank; so
much was added to the money of the
nation.</p>

<p>This bank was more useful than
that of Amsterdam, or England; its
notes passing in most payments, and
through the whole country: the bank
of Amsterdam being only for that
town, and that of England of little
use but at London.</p>

<p>The stop of payments which happened
to the bank of Scotland, was
foreseen, and might have been prevented.
the consumption of foreign
goods, and expence in England, being
more than the export of goods
did pay; the ballance sent out in money
lessened the credit of the bank.
for as credit is voluntary, it depends
on the quantity of money in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
country, and increases or decreases
with it. coyning notes of one pound
supported the bank, by furnishing
paper for small payments, and thereby
preventing a part of the demand
for money: by these notes the bank
might have kept its credit, till other
methods had been taken to supply the
country with money; had not a report
of raising the money occasioned an
extraordinary demand, which in few
days exhausted the money in bank,
and put a stop to payments.</p>

<p>It would not have been easie in
that scarcity of money to have got
enough to support the bank, tho’ men
of the best credit had undertaken it;
that report of raising the money having
only occasioned a demand from
the people in Edinburgh. in a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
time notes would have come in so fast
from the country, that what money
could have been got, would not have
answered the demand.</p>

<p>If the privy council had lowered
the money, the English crown to 5s.
and the other money in proportion,
to take place 2 pence p. crown in 3
days, and the other 3 pence in a
month; the occasion of the demand
being removed, in all appearance money
would have been returned to the
bank.</p>

<p>If the state of the bank had been
known, or suspected by the people;
such a proclamation would have had
the same effect, tho’ the stop of payment
had then happen’d. in that case,
the support of the bank might have
been the narrative of the proclamation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the security being good, few or none
would have kept their money to loss,
rather than return it to the bank. and
if in 3 days money had not come in
so fast as expected, their lordships by
a 2d. proclamation might have lowered
the crown to 5 sh. to take place
then, and 6 pence more in 3 days.
when the credit of the bank had been
re-established, the money might have
been cryed up, if that had been necessary,
the crown to 5 sh. and 5 pence,
and the other money in proportion
as it was before.</p>

<p>Some are against all banks where
the money does not lie pledged equal
to the credit. 1. they say the demand
may be greater than the money in
bank. secondly, if we are declining
in our trade, or money, we are not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
all, or are less sensible of it: and if the
bank fail, we are in a worse condition
than before.</p>

<p>To the first it’s answered, Tho’ the
nation had no benefit by the addition
the bank makes to the money; nor
the people by being supply’d with
money when otherwise they could
not, and at less interest; and tho’ the
proprietors had no gain by it: the other
conveniencies, as quicker and easier
payments, &amp;c. are more than equal
to that hazard; or bank notes, gold-smiths
and bankers notes, would not
be preferred to money, every body
knowing such a stop may happen to
the bank, and that gold-smiths and
bankers may fail.</p>

<p>The other objection is the same
as to say, a merchant who had a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
stock, and was capable of imploying
a greater; if a sum were offered him
without interest, equal to what he had,
and more as his own increased, should
refuse it, because he might fancy himself
richer than he was, and if his own
stock decreased, that sum lent would
be taken from him.</p>

<p>If 15000 is supposed the money
in bank, and 75000 lib. of notes out;
60000 lib. is added to the money of
the nation, without interest: for what
is payed by the borrowers, is got by
the proprietors. as the money of the
nation increases, the credit of the
bank increases, and the sum of notes
out is greater; and so far from making
the people less sensible of the condition
of the country, a surer judgment of
the state of trade and money may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
made from the books of the bank, than
any other way.</p>

<p>If trade can be carried on with a
100000 lib. and a ballance then due
by foreigners; the same measures, and
a greater quantity of money, would
make the ballance greater. nor is
that additional money the bank furnishes,
to be supposed will be lost, if
by a ballance due from trade the silver
money increases: that credit may
fail from an accident when money is
plentiful, and would soon be recover’d;
’tis only lost by a scarcity of money.
such a credit may support trade, in
cases where without it trade would
sink, but cannot do prejudice.</p>

<p>Another objection is made against
the bank. that it encouraged the exportation
of money, by furnishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
sums in such species as were of most
value abroad. to answer this objection,
I shall make a supposition. A. B.
merchant has occasion for a 1000 lib.
in Holland, and desires C. D. banker
to give him a bill for that value;
there is no money due in Holland to
Scots merchants, so C. D. must export
the money to pay the bill he
draws: but, there being no bank, nor
any possibility of getting a 1000 lib.
in 40 pence pieces, he sends out money
of different species. this does not
hinder the money to go out, but
makes the exchange dearer by 2 or 3
per cent, than it would have been if 40
pence pieces could have been got. and
tho’ no other money were left, but
old marks, if a ballance is due, these
will go out, tho’ not worth 10 pence:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the exchange will be so much higher,
the profit of exporting is the same;
and so far from doing hurt to the
country, the bank by furnishing such
pieces as could be exported to least
loss, kept the exchange 2 or 3 per cent
lower than otherwise it would have
been, and saved yearly the sending
out a considerable sum to pay a greater
ballance, the higher exchange
would have occasioned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>The several measures now proposed, considered. as, raising
or allaying the money. coyning the plate. regulating
the ballance of trade. or, re-establishing the bank.</i></p>
</div>


<p>When I use the words, raising the
money, I desire to be understood
raising it in the denomination; for I
do not suppose it adds to the value.</p>

<p>There is no way silver can be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
more valuable, but by lessening the
quantity, or increasing the demand
for it. if the export and consumption
of silver be greater than the import,
or the demand be increased; silver
will be of more value. if the quantity
imported be greater than the quantity
exported or consumed, or the demand
lessened; silver will be of less
value.</p>

<p>If raising or allaying the money
could add to its value, or have any
good effect on home or foreign trade;
then no nation would want money.
a 100 lib. might be raised or allayed
to 2, to 10, to a 100 times the denomination
it had, or more as there were
occasion. but as ’tis unjust to raise, or
allay money; because, then all contracts
are payed with a lesser value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
than was contracted for; and as it has
bad effects on home or foreign trade:
so no nation practises it, that has regard
to justice, or understands the nature
of trade and money. if A. B.
sell 12 chalder of victual for a 100 lib.
payable in 6 months, with which he
is to pay bills of exchange of that value,
to be drawn on him then from
France for wine he has commission’d;
and in that time the money is raised
or allayed to double, the 100 lib. A.
B. receives will only pay half the bill
he has to pay, being only equal to
50 lib. of the money he contracted
for. nor will that 100 lib. buy the
same quantity of goods of the country,
that a 100 lib. bought before: it
will pay where money is due, and
satisfie past contracts made upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
faith of the publick, because the
prince says every man shall take half
what is owing him in full payment.
but in bargains to be made, the value
of the money will be considered;
goods will rise, tho’ perhaps not to
the proportion the money is raised;
and such persons as do not raise their
goods, equal to the money, are imposed
on.</p>

<p>When 6 pence is raised to 12 pence,
the 6 pence is worth 12 pence; but
the value of the pence is lowered to
half-pence.</p>

<p>To explain this matter better, I
shall suppose when money is raised,
goods rise, or not.</p>

<p>If goods rise, then raising the money
has not the effect designed. if
a piece of serge is sold for 40 sh. and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the shilling be raised to 18 pence, the
piece of serge will be sold for 3 lib.
this adds to the tale of the money, and
pays debts with two thirds of what
is due, but does not add to the money.
this is the natural consequence
of raising the money; for, it is not
the sound of the higher denomination,
but the value of the silver is considered.</p>

<p>If, when money is raised, goods
keep the prices they had before: then
all goods exported are sold for a lesser
value abroad, and all goods imported
are sold dearer. a half-crown is raised
to 40 pence, and that half-crown
buys the same quantity of goods 40
pence bought before; then the merchant
who sends goods to Holland,
to the value of 300 lib. which are sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
for 390 lib. there, would gain 220 lib.
on the value of 300 lib. exported: because,
390 lib. in Holland, would be
equal to, or worth by exchange at the
par, or sent in bullion, 520 lib. in Scotland.
that trade would bring no more
profit to the nation, than when the
return of the goods yielded only
390 lib. for, 390 lib. before it was
raised, had the same quantity of silver,
that 520 lib. rais’d money would have;
and bought as great a quantity of
foreign goods. but that trade would
be so profitable to the merchant, that
more people would deal in it than
could get goods to buy; and as more
buyers than sellers would raise the
prices here, so one merchant under-selling
the other would lower the
prices in Holland. but tho’ the prices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
kept low here, and our merchants
kept up the prices abroad: the Dutch
knowing the goods were so cheap in
the country, would buy none from
our merchants, but commission them
in return of goods they sent.</p>

<p>Suppose the yearly export first cost
300000 lib. sold abroad 390000 lib.
the import, and expence abroad
410000 lib. and 20000 lib. sent in
money, to pay the ballance. the money
raised one third, and goods to keep
the prices they had before, 225000 l.
sent to Scotland in foreign money, or
goods, or by exchange, would buy
what was sold abroad for 390000 lib.
the export, import, and expence abroad
continuing the same, Scotland
would be due a ballance of 185000 lib.
for, tho’ Scots goods were sold under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the value, yet other nations would not
sell their goods for less than before;
or than they could have in other
places.</p>

<p>It may be alledged, we have more
product and manufacture, than is
consumed, or exported; and selling
cheaper, would occasion a greater demand
for our goods abroad.</p>

<p>The product and manufacture
might be much increased, if we had
money to imploy the people: but,
I’m of opinion we have not any great
quantity of goods, more than what is
consumed or exported. allow selling
cheaper would occasion a greater demand;
that the greater demand,
would occasion an increase in the product,
and manufacture, to the value
of a 100000 lib. and allow that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
extraordinary cheapness of goods, did
not occasion a greater consumption
in the country: yet, we would be in
the same condition as before; 20000 l.
would be still due of ballance, and the
improvement would be given to foreigners
for nothing. but this improvement
is imaginary, for tho’ the
demand increased, yet without more
money more people could not be imployed,
so no further improvement
could be made: we would be forced to
retrench near one half of the ordinary
consumption of foreign goods, and
expence abroad; not having money to
pay the great ballance would be due.</p>

<p>Some think foreign money being
raised, would bring in money to Scotland.</p>

<p>Tho’ the crown were rais’d to 10 s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
yet if a ballance is due by Scotland,
the exchange will be above the par,
and, ’tis not to be supposed an English
merchant will bring crowns to Scotland,
when for a 100 payed in at London,
he can have 105 or 6 of the same
crowns payed him at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>If the ballance of trade was equal,
foreign money raised, and Scots money
not raised in proportion; foreign
money would be brought in, and a
greater value of Scots money would
be carried out. ’tis the same loss to a
country when money is raised, and
goods do not rise in proportion: if foreigners
send in money to buy goods,
and this money when exported is not
valued so high as here; the return in
goods will be so much less, besides the
want of the profit we would have had
on the export of our goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>If all import, and foreign expence
were discharged, Scotland would then
be so much richer, as there was bullion
or money imported: but, if that prohibition
be supposed, Scotland would
be richer by keeping the money at the
value it has; because, a greater quantity
would be brought in, to buy the
same quantity of goods.</p>

<p>If we could be supposed to be
without any commerce with other
nations, a 100 lib. may be allayed and
raised to have the same effect in trade
as a million: but, if a stranger were
suffered to come to Scotland, he might
purchase a great part of the land or
goods with a small sum. and a rich
man here would make a very small
figure abroad.</p>

<p>Money is the measure by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
all goods are valued; and unless goods
rise to the full proportion the money
is raised, the goods are undervalued.
if the yearly value of Scotland in product
and manufacture be 2 millions,
at 20 years purchase 40 millions. the
money a 100000 lib. raising the money
20 per cent, makes it pass for a
120000 lib. suppose the goods rise
only 10 per cent, then that a 120000 l,
is equal in Scotland to a 110000 l.
of the money before it was raised; and
buys the same quantity of goods. so,
an addition is made of 20000 lib. to
the tale and of 10000 lib. to the value
of Scots or foreign money, compared
with the value of Scots goods: but the
measure by which goods are valued,
being raised in the denomination 20
per cent; and the goods rising only 10<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
per cent: Scotland is near 4 million,
or one tenth less valuable than before.
and any man who sells his estate, will
receive a tenth less silver, or of any
other foreign goods for it, than if he
had sold it before the money was
raised.</p>

<p>France and Holland are given as
examples of raising and allaying the
money. in France the money is higher
in the denomination than in other
countries, but that does not hinder
the money of France to be exported.
when the lued’ore was at 12 livres, the
ballance was against France, exchange
10 per cent above the par: and a 110
lued’ores at 12 livres were payed then
at Paris, for a 100 lued’ores of the same
weight and fineness at Amsterdam,
and passing there for 9 guilders bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
money; so 10 per cent was got by
exporting money from France. when
the lued’ore was raised to 14 livres,
that did not make the ballance against
France less; the exchange continued
the same, 110 lued’ores tho’ at 14
livres were payed for a bill of a 100
at Amsterdam, and the same profit
was made by exporting money. if
the exchange happened to be lower,
it was from the ballance of trade due
by France being less, and that would
have lowered the exchange whether
the money had been raised or not. but
the raising the money, so far from
bringing the ballance to the French
side, keeps the ballance against France:
for, as their goods do not rise to the
full proportion the money is raised,
so French goods are sold cheaper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and foreign goods are sold dearer,
which makes the ballance greater, occasions
a greater export of money,
sets idle so many of the people as that
money employed, lessens the product
or manufacture, the yearly value of
the country, and the number of the
people.</p>

<p>’Tis thought the Dutch coin lued’ores,
and send them to France,
where they pass at 14 livres. and,
that guineas were sent from Holland
to England, in the time of the clipt
money; because they past there for
30 s. but these people are misinformed.
ever since I have known any thing of
exchange, a lued’ore at Amsterdam
whether new or old, has been of more
value by exchange, than a new lued’ore
at Paris. and in the time of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
clipt money, a guinea in Holland was
worth more by exchange, than a
guinea in England. these who were
ignorant of the exchange, might buy
up guineas or lued’ores, to carry to
England or France, but they would
have got more by bill. there was a
profit then upon exporting guineas
and lued’ores from England and
France to Holland. the pound English
at that time was given for 8 guilders,
or under; and the exchange
from Amsterdam to Paris has been
these 8 or 10 years for the most part,
considerably above the par on the
Dutch side. I have known the pound
English at 7 guilders 13 stivers, and
the French crown of 3 livres bought
in Holland for 37 stivers, in London
for 39 pence half penny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Raising the money in France is
laying a tax on the people, which
is sooner payed, and thought to be
less felt than a tax laid on any other
way. when the King raises the lued’ore
from 12 livres to 14, they are taken
in at the mint for 13 livres, and given
out for 14; so the King gains a livre
on the lued’ore, and this tax comes
to 20 or 25 million of livres, sometimes
more, according to the quantity
of money in the country. but so far
from adding to the money, it stops the
circulation: a part being kept up till
there is occasion to export it to Holland,
from whence a return is made
by bill, of a sum of livres equal to the
same quantity of new lued’ores that
were exported of old ones, and 8 or
10 per cent more, according as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
exchange is on the Dutch side. others
who won’t venture to send the money
out, keep it till the new money
is cryed down, so save a 13th part,
which the King would have got if
they had carried the money to the
mint to be recoined. this tax falls
heavy on the poorer sort of the people.</p>

<p>’Tis generally thought the Dutch
money is not worth half what it passes
for. but it will prove otherwise when
examined. the bank by which most
payments are made, receive and pay
in bank money, which is better than
the English, ducatdowns are at 3 guilders,
and other bank money in proportion;
and I’m informed the current
money has silver in it to the value
or near, except some of their skellings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
which are worse than others: the
making them worse was not design’d,
it was an abuse occasioned by too
many towns having power to coin:
which abuse was stopt so soon as
known, and that species cryed down
to 5 stivers and a half.</p>

<p>Some propose the money may be
raised, to give the little we have left
a better circulation, and to bring out
hoarded money. the lowering it by
degrees to take place in 3 or 4 months,
will have the same effect; and other
good consequences: for, from what
has been said, page 54 and 55. there
is reason to think, if the money were
lowered to the English standard, exchange
would be on our side, and a
ballance due us: providing the export,
the import, and expence abroad continued
as now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>There is another argument for
raising the money, which is, that some
goods don’t yield profit enough abroad,
so are not exported. if serges
worth in Scotland a 100 lib. are
worth 120 in Holland, the merchant
won’t export them for 20 per cent
profit: but if the money is raised 20
per cent, and goods keep at the prices
they had before, the same money that
bought 100 lib. of serges, buying now
to the value of 120 lib. and these
goods being worth in Holland 144 lib:
that addition to the profit by raising
the money, will occasion the export
of them.</p>

<p>This is the same as if a merchant
who had a 100 different sorts of goods,
and was offered 30 per cent profit
upon 90 of them; but no body offering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
above 20 per cent profit for the
other 10 sorts, should add a quarter to
the measure by which he measured
his goods, and sell all the 100 sorts
for the same price he sold them before:
as this merchant would find himself
a considerable loser by this expedient,
so will a nation who raises their money.</p>

<p>For the same reason, it would be
a great loss to Scotland if all goods
were allowed to be exported without
duty; some ought to be free of duty,
and some not, according to their value
abroad.</p>

<p>The true and safe way to encourage
the export of such goods, as do
not yield great enough profit; is by a
draw-back. if serges sent to Holland
give only 20 percent profit, 10 per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
cent given as a draw-back will encourage
their export: the draw-back given
to the merchant is not lost to the
nation, and what is got by the manufacture
or export of the goods, is
gained by the nation.</p>

<p>A draw-back is the best method
yet known for encouraging trade,
and it may be made appear, that 10
or 15000 applyed that way, will occasion
an addition to the export to the
value of a 100000 lib. nor is any part
of that 10 or 15000 lib. lost to the
nation; for, if A. B. and C. Scots-men
get such draw-back, it is the same
thing to the nation, as if it had not
been given. when draw-backs are paid
out of funds for the support of the
government, little money is applyed
that way; because, so much is taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
from the prince: but, if there was a
national fund for the encouragement
of trade, that nation might improve
trade, and undersell other nations
that did not follow the same measures.
but this is supposing there was money
in the country to imploy the people.</p>

<p>Coining the plate were a loss of
the fashion, which may be valued
one 6th, and would add little to the
money: the plate at the restauration
was inconsiderable, having been called
in a little before. since there may
have been wrought one year with another
about 60 stone weight; of that
a great part has been melted down,
or exported, the remainder won’t be
of great value. what plate has been
imported belongs to a few men of
quality, who will send it out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
country rather than lose the fashion;
and in that they do a service to the
country, providing they don’t spend
it abroad, because wrought plate will
sell for more silver at London, than
it will melt to here.</p>

<p>If ’tis proposed the money be allayed,
and the advantage of the allay
be given to the owners of the plate.
suppose the new money with allay be
raised to double the denomination;
5 sh. of plate with the fashion worth
6 sh. will give at the mint 10 sh. allay’d
money: but even then the plate will
not be brought in voluntarily, for that
plate sold in England, and the value
brought back by bill, will yield from
11 to 12 sh. exchange being above
the par, and 6 pence supposed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
got for the fashion of the ounce of
plate.</p>

<p>If it be necessary to coin the plate,
such plate should be allowed to be
exported as can be sold abroad for
more than its weight: security being
given to import money or bullion to
the value.</p>

<p>Some propose a regulation of the
ballance of trade, by retrenching the
consumption of foreign goods, and
expence in England: so the ballance
being brought to be on our side, we
may become rich by living within our
yearly value, as we became poor by
spending beyond it.</p>

<p>Such a regulation will have its difficulties.
1. to discharge all or a great
part of the import, will lessen considerably
the revenue of the crown; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
her majesty may not think good to give
the royal assent to such a regulation,
unless an equivalent be given. 2. such
a regulation would not be so strictly
kept, but a part of what was used to
be imported would be stole in. 3. the
residence of our princes being in
England, we are under a necessity of
having a ministry there: imployments
being at the disposal of the prince,
and London being a place of more
diversion than Edinburgh, the gentry
will continue to go to London for
places or pleasure.</p>

<p>But allowing the royal assent
were given to such a regulation; either
with or without an equivalent;
and the regulation could be so strictly
kept, that nothing were imported contrair
to that law; and allow 20000 lib.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
could be saved of the expence in England,
so that the import and expence
abroad should be 60000 lib. less than
last year: yet there are other difficulties,
that I fear will make the regulation
ineffectual.</p>

<p>1. Suppose the ballance last year
due by us was 20000 lib. the import
and expence abroad lessened 60000 l.
these who propose this regulation
may think a ballance will be due to
us of 40000 lib. but as the bank may
have supplyed us with 60000 lib.
of notes, more than the money in
bank: and as 20000 lib. is supposed
to have been exported last year: so
our money being lessened 80000 lib.
the next year’s export may be so much
less valuable, the want of that money
having set idle a part of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
were then imployed: and a greater
ballance be due than last year, notwithstanding
of the regulation.</p>

<p>2. 40000 lib. first cost of goods
imported, and 20000 lib. spent abroad,
lessened the consumption of
the goods of the country; and the
export was by so much greater, as the
consumption of the goods of the
country was lessened. but this regulation
occasioning a greater consumption
of the goods of the country, the
export will be less.</p>

<p>3. Several merchants may have
exported goods, tho’ they had not
much profit upon the export of them;
but because of the profit to be made
upon the import; which being lessen’d,
may likewise lessen the export.</p>

<p>4. If Scotland discharge or put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
very high duty on the goods of other
nations, other nations may discharge
Scots goods.</p>

<p>Allowing there were no difficulties
in regulating the ballance of trade,
and that the same measures were followed
as are followed in Holland;
we would grow richer, but their riches
would increase in the same proportion:
and 50 years hence Scotland would
be as poor as now, in comparison with
Holland.</p>

<p>If two countries equal in their
product, people, &amp;c. the one with
a 100000 lib. of money, and living
within its yearly value; so that the
first year a ballance is due of 20000 l.
the second year of 25000 lib. and so
on. the other country with 20 millions
of money, and consuming more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
than the yearly value; so that a million
is sent out to pay the ballance,
the second year 1200000 lib. and so
on. this country will be soon poor,
and the other be soon rich: but if that
people who has 20 millions of money,
will retrench in proportion to the other;
they will be rich and powerful
in comparison with the other.</p>

<p>Considering how small a share
we have of the money of Europe,
and how much trade depends on money:
it will not be found very practicable
to better our condition, but by
an addition to our money. or if it is
practicable without it, it is much more
so with it.</p>

<p>The bank will add little to the
money; for as credit is voluntary, it
depends on the quantity of money in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the country. and tho’ the bank had
never failed, yet it could not have kept
its credit much longer. because, the
quantity of money in Scotland is not
sufficient to give a circulation to such
a sum of notes, as will pay the charges
of the bank, and the interest to the
owners.</p>

<p>’Tis thought the proprietors of
the bank design to apply to the parliament
for further priviledges: but as
their design is not yet made publick,
I shall only say in general, that if other
priviledges are to be given, then
it is not the same bank; at least not
on the same establishment it was: in
either of these cases, every person
should be allowed to share in it.</p>

<p>When a bank is establish’d every
person may have a share, upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
terms of the act of parliament; and
he that offers first is preferred. suppose
upon the setting up of the bank,
A. B. and C. did not subscribe to it,
because they thought the establishment
not favourable enough: so long
as they who did subscribe can support
the bank upon the terms of the act of
parliament, none will pretend to any
share in it; unless the subscribers are
pleased to sell. but if other priviledges
are given, A. B. and C. as any others
of the country may desire the books
to be opened, that they be allowed
to share in it; and any other set of
men who offer the same security, may
at the same time be allowed to set up
a bank with the same priviledges: so
every shire in Scotland will desire
one. and if new priviledges are given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
to this bank, it were a hardship to
refuse the same to others, who are
able and willing to give the same
security, especially when the nation
stands in need of more money than
this bank would be allowed to give out.</p>

<p>National power and wealth consists
in numbers of people, and magazines
of home and foreign goods.
these depend on trade, and trade depends
on money. so to be powerful
and wealthy in proportion to other
nations, we should have money in
proportion with them; for the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
laws without money cannot employ
the people, improve the product, or
advance manufacture and trade.</p>

<p>The measures have been used to
preserve and increase money, or such
as are now proposed, are attended
with difficulties; and tho’ the difficulties
were removed, are ineffectual,
and not capable to furnish money so
as to improve the country, or extend
trade in any proportion to the improvements
and trade of other nations.</p>

<p>Credit that promises a payment
of money, cannot well be extended
beyond a certain proportion it ought
to have with the money. and we have
so little money, that any credit could
be given upon it, would be inconsiderable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>It remains to be considered, whether
any other goods than silver, can
be made money with the same safety
and convenience.</p>

<p>From what has been said about
the nature of money, chap. 1. it is
evident, that any other goods which
have the qualities necessary in money,
may be made money equal to
their value, with safety and convenience.
there was nothing of humour
or fancy in making silver to be money;
it was made money, because it
was thought best qualified for that
use.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour to prove, that another
money may be establisht, with
all the qualities necessary in money
in a greater degree than silver; with
other qualities that silver has not: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
preferable for that use, tho’ silver were
the product of Scotland. and that by
this money, the people may be employed,
the country improved, manufacture
advanced, trade domestick
and foreign be carried on, and wealth
and power attained.</p>

<p>What I propose, will I hope be
found safe, and practicable; advantageous
in general to Scotland, and in
particular to every Scots-man.</p>

<p>But as I offer to prove, that what
I shall propose is more qualified for
the use of money than silver: so before
I come to the proposal, I shall shew
some defects in silver money; and
that it has not, nor does not answer
the design of money.</p>

<p>Money is the measure by which
goods are valued, the value by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
goods are exchanged, and in which
contracts are made payable.</p>

<p>Money is not a pledge, as some call
it. it’s a value payed, or contracted to
be payed, with which ’tis supposed
the receiver may, as his occasions require,
buy an equal quantity of the
same goods he has sold, or other
goods equal in value to them: and that
money is the most secure value, either
to receive, to contract for, or to value
goods by; which is least liable to a
change in its value.</p>

<p>Silver money is more uncertain in
its value than other goods, so less
qualified for the use of money.</p>

<p>The power the magistrate has to
alter the money in its denomination
or fineness, takes away the chief quality
for which silver was made money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
in countries where the money is often
changed in the denomination or
fineness, ’tis more uncertain to contract
for money, than it was in the
state of barter to contract for goods.
if a 100 ounces of silver are lent, or
contracted for, and a bond given for
them denominat pounds, payable in
a year: in that time half a crown is
raised to a crown, and 50 ounces pays
the 100 lent, or contracted for.</p>

<p>Tho’ the magistrate did never alter
the money in its denomination or
fineness, yet it is more uncertain in
its value than other goods.</p>

<p>Goods of the same kind and
quality differ in value, from any
change in their quantity, or in the demand
for them: in either of these
cases goods are said to be dearer, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
cheaper, being more or less valuable,
and equal to a greater or lesser quantity
of other goods, or of money.</p>

<p>Silver in bullion or money changes
its value, from any change in its
quantity, or in the demand for it: in
either of these cases goods are said
to be dearer, or cheaper; but ’tis silver
or money is dearer or cheaper,
being more or less valuable, and equal
to a greater or lesser quantity of goods.</p>

<p>Perishable goods as corns, &amp;c.
increase or decrease in quantity as the
demand for them increases or decreases;
so their value continues equal
or near the same.</p>

<p>More durable goods as mettals,
materials for shipping, &amp;c. increase
in quantity beyond the demand for
them, so are less valuable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Silver or money increases in quantity
by so much as is imported to Europe,
more than is consumed or exported.
the demand has encreased,
but not in proportion to the quantity;
for, 1st. the same quantity of
silver or money, won’t purchase the
same quantity of goods as before.
2dly. 10 per cent was payed for the
use of it; now ’tis to be had at 6, in
Holland at 3 or 4.</p>

<p>An ounce of silver being worth
5 sh. and 2 pence, and a crown
worth 60 pence, unless altered by
the prince, makes most people insensible
of any change in the value of
silver or money: but as one year the
boll of barley is sold for 2 crowns,
and the year after for 3; this difference
comes from a change in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
quantity or demand of the barley, or
of the money: and that of the money
will occasion a difference in the price,
as well as that of the barley.</p>

<p>If last year a 100 sheep were sold
for a 100 crowns, and the person
sold them desires this year to buy the
same number of sheep; tho’ the quantity
of the sheep, and the demand for
them be the same as last year: yet if
the money is increased in quantity, and
the demand for it not increased in
proportion, the 100 sheep will be equal
in value to more money than the
year before, so the money is cheaper.
if the quantity of the money, and
the demand for it be the same as before;
yet if the sheep are lesser in quantity,
or the demand for them greater:
the 100 sheep will be equal to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
greater quantity of money, so the
sheep are dearer.</p>

<p>So tho’ the magistrate did never
alter the money, yet ’tis liable to a
change in its value as silver; from
any change in its quantity, or in the
demand for it: and the receiver is
doubly uncertain whether the money
he receives or contracts for, will,
when he has occasion, buy him the
same goods he has sold, or other
goods equal in value to them; because
of the difference may happen in the
value of the money, or the goods
he is to buy.</p>

<p>And this uncertainty is, tho’ both
money and goods were certain in their
quality.</p>

<p>The difference of the prices of
most goods, from changes in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
quantity, or in the demand for them,
would be much prevented, if magazines
were kept; but the difference
in their prices from the greater or
lesser quantity of, or demand for money;
cannot be prevented so long as
silver is the money.</p>

<p>That money is of much lesser value
than it was; will appear by the
value goods, land, and money had
200 years ago.</p>

<p>By the acts of the council of Edinburgh,
it appears, that anno 1495,
the fiars for wheat was 6 sh. and 8
pennies Scots money the boll.</p>

<p>Anno 1520, claret and white
French wines were ordered to be sold
in the taverns at 6 pennies Scots the
pint, and ale at 20 pennies Scots the
gallon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Anno 1526, the milns belonging
to the town were lett for 400 merks
Scots, now they give 13000.</p>

<p>The petty customs at Leith then
lett for 115 merks.</p>

<p>Anno 1532, the load of malt containing
9 firlots, was ordered to be sold
at 32 sh. Scots the load.</p>

<p>Anno 1551, ordered that the best
mutton bulk be sold for 12 pennies
Scots, the 2d. sort for 10 pennies, and
the worst sort for 8 pennies.</p>

<p>Anno 1553, the 9 firlots of malt
old measure, with the charity, is ordered
to be sold for 36 sh. Scots. the
landwart bread to weigh 40 ounces,
and the townbread 36 ounces the 4
penny or plack loaf.</p>

<p>Anno 1555, the bakers are ordered
for each boll of wheat, to deliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
7 score loafs, at 16 ounces the loaf.</p>

<p>By an act of the 5th parliament of
Queen Mary, anno 1551. ’tis ordained,
that wines imported upon the east
and north coast, should not be sold
dearer than 20 lib. Scots the tun of
Bourdeaux wine, and 16 lib. the tun
of Rochel wine. the pint of Bourdeaux
wine 10 pennies, and the pint
of Rochel wine 8 pennies. and that
wine imported upon the west coast,
be sold no dearer than 16 lib. Scots
the tun of Bourdeaux wine, and 12
or 13 lib. the tun of Rochel wine.
8 pennies the pint of Bourdeaux wine,
and 6 pennies the pint of Rochel
wine.</p>

<p>So that what 5 lib. bought 200
years ago, will not be bought now
for a 100 lib. nor were goods in greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
plenty, or of less value than now:
on the contrair, as these acts were
made to regulate the prices of goods,
’tis reasonable to think they were in
lesser quantity than now, proportioned
to the demand, so of more value.
but money having increased in quantity,
more than in demand, and having
been altered by the prince; is
fallen in value: and a 100 lib. now
is not worth what 5 lib. was worth
before.</p>

<p>Land may be computed to have
been improved in 200 years, that
what pays now two bolls the acre,
payed then but one boll: which may
be known from old rentals.</p>

<p>Money gave then 10 per cent interest,
and as 384 acres, rented at a
boll the acre, victual at 8 sh. and 4 d.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the chalder; so the property of these
acres was equal to, or worth a 100l.
for a 100 lib. gave 10 lib. interest,
and the 384 acres payed only such a
quantity of victual, as was sold for
10 lib. but as land (being preferable
to money for many reasons) is valued
now at 20 years purchase, tho’
money is at 6 per cent: so that land
then may have been valued 14 years
purchase or 140 lib.</p>

<p>As the quantity of money has increased
since that time, much more
than the demand for it; and as the
same quantity of silver has received
a higher denomination, so of consequence
money is of lesser value: a
lesser interest is given for it: A greater
quantity of it is given for the same
quantity of goods, and the land is
worth more years purchase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>The value of such land now, the
acre rented at 2 bolls, victual at 8 lib.
6 sh. and 6 pence, money at 6 per cent,
so land at 20 years purchase, would
be 8000 lib. by this computation
money is only worth the 20th part
of goods, and the 57th part of land,
it was worth 200 years ago. part of
this difference is from the improvement
made on land, and the greater
demand for land, the quantity being
the same, whereby its value is greater:
the rest of the difference is, from the
money being more encreased in
quantity, than in demand, whereby
its value is lesser, and its use lower: as
likewise from its being altered in the
denomination.</p>

<p>There was then a greater quantity
of silver in the same number of pence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
than there is now: which appears by
several acts of parliament made about
that time.</p>

<p>Anno 1475, in the 8 par. of K.
James the 3. the ounce of silver was
ordered to be sold for 12 sh. Scots,
and 12 groats was made of the ounce
of silver.</p>

<p>The 3d. of November 1554, by
an act of the town-council of Edinburgh,
the ounce of silver was ordered
to be sold at 18 sh. and 8 pennies
Scots; but these acts do not mention
the fineness the silver was of. suppose
the same number of pence had
twice or 4 times the value of silver in
them that they have now: then silver
is only fallen to one tenth, or one
fifth of the value it had to goods; and
to one 28th, or one 14 of the value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
it had to land. but still money is fallen
to one 20th of the value it had to
goods, and to one 57th of the value it
had to land.</p>

<p>The manner of lending money in
France, and I suppose in other Roman
Catholick countries; is by way of
perpetual interest, redeemable by the
debitor, and which the creditor may
dispone or assign, but can never demand
the principal. and it is usury
by law to take any interest for money,
if the creditor has power to call for
the principal, tho’ the term of payment
be many years after the money
is lent. suppose the manner of lending
in Scotland was the same 200 years
ago, and that A. B. having 768 acres
of land, rented at a boll of victual
the acre, the yearly rent 48 chalder, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
5 lib. Scots the chalder, 20 lib. sterl.
C. D. worth a 100 lib. in money, to
have lent it to A. B. and interest being
at 10 per cent, to have received
an annual interest of 10 lib. which he
left to his son, and thought he had
provided sufficiently for him, 10 lib.
being equal to, or worth 24 chalder of
victual. but interest being lowered to
6 per cent, money being raised in the
denomination, and of less value by its
greater quantity: the 6 lib. now paid
for the annual interest of that 100 l.
is not worth one chalder of victual.
and 384 acres, or the half of A. B’s
land 200 years ago only equal to a
100, or a 140 lib; is now worth 57
times that sum, the rental supposed to
be doubled, and its value at 20 years
purchase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>In France it has been observed,
that about 200 years ago, the same
land was in 30 years worth double the
money it was worth before. so land
worth a 100 lib. anno 1500, was
worth 200 lib. anno 1530. 400 lib.
anno 1560. and so on, till within
these 50 or 60 years it has continued
near the same value.</p>

<p>In England 20 times the quantity
of money is given for goods, that was
given 200 years ago. in these countries
’tis thought goods have rose; but
goods have kept their value, ’tis money
has fallen.</p>

<p>Most goods have increased in
quantity, equal or near as the demand
for them has increased; and are at or
near the value they had 200 years ago.
land is more valuable, by improvement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
producing to a greater value,
and the demand increasing, the quantity
being the same. silver and money
are of lesser value, being more
increased in quantity, than in demand.</p>

<p>Goods will continue equal in
quantity as they are now to the demand,
or won’t differ much: for the
increase of most goods depends on
the demand. if the quantity of oats
be greater than the demand for consumption
and magazines, what is over
is a drug, so that product will be
lessened, and the land imployed to
some other use: if by a scarcity the
quantity be lesser than the demand,
that demand will be supplyed from
magazines of former years; or if the
magazines are not sufficient to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
the demand, that scarcity cannot well
be supposed to last above a year or
two.</p>

<p>Land will continue to rise in value,
being yet capable of improvement;
and as the demand increases, for the
quantity will be the same.</p>

<p>Silver will continue to fall in value,
as it increases in quantity, the demand
not increasing in proportion; for the
increase does not depend on the demand.
most people won’t allow themselves
to think that silver is cheaper
or less valuable, tho’ it appears plainly,
by comparing what quantity of
goods such a weight of fine silver
bought 200 years ago, and what
quantity of the same goods it will
buy now. if a piece of wine in
France is equal in value to 20 bolls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
of oats there, that quantity of oats
can never be worth more or less wine;
so long as the quality, quantity and
demand of both continues the same:
but any disproportioned change in
their quality, quantity or demand, will
make the same quantity of the one,
be equal to a greater quantity of the
other. so if a piece of wine in France,
is equal to or worth 40 crowns there;
it will always continue so, unless some
disproportioned change happen in the
quantity, quality, or demand of the
wine, or of the money.</p>

<p>The reason is plain, why silver
has encreased more in quantity than
in demand: the Spaniards bring as
great quantities into Europe as they
can get wrought out of the mines,
for it is still valued tho’ not so high.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and tho’ none of it come into Britain,
yet it will be of less value in Britain,
as it is in greater quantity in Europe.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the demand
for silver is now greater than
the quantity. it is answered: tho’ the
demand is greater than the quantity;
yet it has not increased in proportion
with the quantity. 200 years ago
money or silver was at 10 per cent,
now from 6 to 3. if the demand had
increased as much as the quantity,
money would give 10 p. cent as then,
and be equal to the same quantity of
victual, or other goods that have
kept their value. if A. B. having a
1000 lib. to lend, should offer it at
10 per. cent. interest, and desired
land of 240 chalder of victual rent
for his security, as was used to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
given 200 years ago: tho’ no law
regulate the interest of money, A. B.
would find no borrowers on these
conditions; because silver having
increased more in quantity than in
demand, and the denomination being
altered, money is of less value, and is
to be had on easier terms. if the demand
had encreased in the same proportion
with the quantity, and the
money had not been raised, the same
interest would be given now as then,
and the same quantity of victual to
pay the interest; for money keeping
its value, 8 sh. and 4 pence would be
equal to a chalder of victual, as it was
then.</p>

<p>If 2000 lib. was laid out on plate
200 years ago, it is thought the loss
on the plate was only the fashion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and the interest; but if the 2000 lib.
had been laid out on land, the rent
of that land would be more than the
value of such plate.</p>

<p>Tho’ money or silver is so much
fallen from the value it had, yet it’s
given as a value for one half, or two
thirds more than its value as silver,
abstract from its use as money.</p>

<p>Suppose silver to be no more used
as money in Europe, its quantity
would be the same, and the demand for
it much lesser; which might lower
it 2 thirds or more; for besides that
the demand would be less, its uses as
plate, &amp;c. are not near so necessary,
as that of money.</p>

<p>Goods given as a value, ought for
their other uses to be valuable, equal
to what they are given for. silver was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
bartered as it was valued for its uses
as a metal, and was at first given as
money, according to the value it had
in barter. silver has acquired an additional
value since, that additional
use it was applyed to occasioning a
greater demand for it; which value
people have not been sensible of, the
greater quantity making it fall more:
but it has kept it from falling so low
it would have fallen, if it had not
been used as money, and the same
quantity had come into Europe.</p>

<p>’Tis uncertain how long silver
may keep that additional value: if
England set up a money of another
kind, silver will not fall to one third,
because used in other places as money;
but the lesser demand, besides the
ordinary fall from the greater quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
coming into Europe, would occasion
an extraordinary fall perhaps of
10 per cent: if the new money then
in England did not encrease beyond
the demand for it, it would keep its
value, and be equal to so much more
silver at home or abroad than it was
coined for; as silver would be of less
value, from the ordinary and extraordinary
fall.</p>

<p>If England changed their money,
other countries may do the same. if
Holland alone kept to silver money,
the price of silver may be supposed to
fall immediately 50 per cent, from the
lesser demand for it as money. and a
100 lib. in Holland be worth no more
than 50 lib. new money in England,
whether sent in specie or remitted by
exchange; and as more silver came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Europe, it would fall yet lower,
because of its greater quantity.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that in Scotland
the quantity of goods are proportioned
to the demand as they have
been some years ago; and money
scarcer, the demand for it the same
or greater. so if goods and money
are higher or lower in value, from
their greater or lesser quantity in proportion
to the demand for them;
money should by its great scarcity be
more valuable, and equal to a greater
quantity of goods. yet goods differ
little in price, from what they were
when money was in greater quantity.</p>

<p>To this it’s answered, the value
of goods or money differs, as the
quantity of them or demand for them
changes in Europe; not as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
change in any particular country.
goods in Scotland are at or near the
same value with goods in England,
being near the same in quantity in
proportion to the demand as there:
money in Scotland is not above one
40th part of the money in England,
proportioned to the people, land, or
product; nor above a 10th part proportioned
to the demand. if Scotland
was incapable of any commerce
with other countries, and in the state
it is now, money here would buy 10
times the quantity of goods it does in
England, or more: but as Scotland
has commerce with other countries,
tho’ money were much scarcer than
now, or in much greater quantity
than in England; if there were but
10000 lib. in Scotland, or a million,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
the value of goods would not differ
above 30 per cent, from what they
were abroad, because for that difference
goods may be exported, or imported.
prohibitions may raise the
difference higher.</p>

<p>Brittannia languens and others
on trade and money, are of opinion
that goods in any country fall in value,
as money in that particular country
grows scarcer. that, if there was no
more than 500 lib. in England, the
yearly rent of England would not
exceed 500 lib. and an ox would be
sold for a penny. which opinion is
wrong, for as the ox might be exported
to Holland, it would give a price
in England equal or near to that it
would give in Holland: if money
were supposed to be equally scarce in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Holland, and other places as in England,
the ox might give no more than
a penny, but that penny would have
a value then equal to 5 lib. now;
because it would purchase the same
quantity of goods in England or
other places, that 5 lib. does now.</p>

<p>The same answer may be given to
these who think an addition to the
money of any particular country
would undervalue it so, that the same
quantity of goods would cost double
the money as before.</p>

<p>If the money and credit current
in England be 15 millions, Scotland
reckoned as 1 to 10, the money in
Scotland encreased to a million and a
half, the demand in proportion to
the demand in England; that addition
to the money of Scotland, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
not make money of less value here,
than it is now in England. goods
in Scotland would sell as they sell in
England, the product of the country
would perhaps be 10 or 20 per cent
dearer, to bring it equal to what it
sells in England; but all sorts of manufacture
would be cheaper, because
in greater quantity: and all goods imported
would be cheaper, money being
easier borrowed, merchants would
deal for a greater value, and men of
estates would be capacitate to trade,
and able to sell at less profit. nor
would land rise higher than in England,
the buyer having in his choice
to buy elsewhere; the better security
of a register may be supposed to add
a year’s purchase or two to the value.</p>

<p>If the money of any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
country should encrease beyond the
proportion that country bears to Europe;
it would undervalue money
there, or, according to the way of
speaking, it would raise goods: but
as money would be undervalued every
where the same, or near to what it
were there; it would be of great advantage
to that country, tho’ thereby
money were less valuable: for that
country would have the whole benefit
of the greater quantity, and only bear
a share of the lesser value, according
to the proportion its money had to
the money of Europe. when the
Spaniards bring money or bullion into
Europe, they lessen its value, but
gain by bringing it; because they have
the whole benefit of the greater quantity,
and only bear a share of the lesser
value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>What has been said, proves, 1st.
that silver money is an uncertain value;
because lyable to be altered in
the fineness or denomination by the
prince. A crown has no more
silver in it than half a crown or 15
pence had a 150 or 200 years ago.</p>

<p>2dly. That as silver it has fallen
from the value it had, the same quantity
not being worth the 5th or 10th
part of what it was worth then.
A moneyed man then worth a
1000 lib. was richer at that time than
a landed man of 240 chalder of victual
rent: but a man of such a money
estate, would not now be worth one
50th part of such a land estate.</p>

<p>3dly, That tho’ fallen so much,
yet it is given as money or sold as bullion,
for much more than its value as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
a metal; to which it will be reduced,
so soon as another money is set up.</p>

<p>Considering the present state of
Europe, France and Spain being masters
of the mines, the other nations
seem to be under a necessity of setting
up another money. the only reason can
be given why it has not yet been done,
is, that the nature of money has not
been rightly understood: or they
would not have continued buying silver
from Spain above its value as a metal,
when they had a more valuable
money of their own; and every way
more fitted for that use.</p>

<p>The receiver of silver can have no
great hopes that the value of it will be
greater; for ’tis not to be supposed it
will be apply’d to any other uses, than
it is now apply’d to, whereby the demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
for it may be encreas’d: or that
the quantity exported and consum’d,
will be greater than the quantity imported.</p>

<p>Tho’ it be scarce in any particular
country, yet the money’d men will
have no great benefit by such scarcity,
as has been shown: for unless the
scarcity is the same in all places with
which that country trades, money
will not be valued much higher there
than in other countries.</p>

<p>If it is alledged the mines in the
West Indies may fail. ’tis the interest
of the Spaniards to give out that their
mines begin to fail, to keep up the
price of silver; but if that were true,
France ought not to have engaged her
self in a war, when by the partition
treaty she could have got any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
parts of that monarchy that are valuable.
allowing the mines do fail, we
ought the rather to provide ourselves
with another money.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>The proposal given in to Parliament by Dr. H. C. examined.</i></p>
</div>


<p>I did not intend to have said any
thing about the Dr’s proposal, that
affair having been referr’d to a committee,
who are to make their report.
but several people who are of opinion
that the Dr’s proposal is not practicable,
being against what I am to
propose, because they think ’tis the
same with his in some other dress: I
thought it needful to give a short account
of the Dr’s proposal, and in
what I differ from him.</p>

<p>His proposal is to give out notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
upon land, to be cancell’d by yearly
payments of about 2 and a quarter
per cent, for 45 years. and that these
notes be current as silver money, to
the value they are coin’d for.</p>

<p>If notes given out after that manner,
were equal in value to silver money;
then every landed man in Scotland,
would desire a share of this great
and certain advantage: and I don’t
see how it is practicable to give every
landed man a share.</p>

<p>Supposing it practicable, 45 years
purchase in these notes, will not be of
so much value, as 20 years purchase
of silver money.</p>

<p>No anticipation is equal to what
already is. a years rent now is worth
15 years rent 50 years hence, because
that money let out at interest, by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
time will produce so much. and tho’
the parliament would force these
notes, yet they would not have currency,
any more than if the government
coin’d pieces of gold equal in
weight and fineness, with a guinea,
and ordered them to pass for 5 lib.</p>

<p>These bills are propos’d to be repay’d
and cancell’d in a term of years,
without paying any interest, but only
so much as would defray the charges
of the office, which would not be
above one half per cent.</p>

<p>There would then be many lenders,
but few if any borrowers, except
from the land bank: for as ’tis the landed
man borrows of the money’d man,
he would satisfie his creditor, and have
bills to lend. the money’d man would
likewise have of these bills to lend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
but there would be no borrowers; or
if any desired to borrow, they would
have these bills at a very low use. suppose
at 2 per cent, then these bills
would be considerably less valuable
than silver.</p>

<p>Any thing that is propos’d to have
a currency as money, and is given for
a lesser interest than silver money, will
be of less value.</p>

<p>It is not to be suppos’d any person
will lend silver money at 2 per cent,
when they can have 6 per cent in
England. so a 100 lib. silver money,
will yield as much as 300 lib. of these
bills would: and 100 lib. in silver, will
be equal to 300 lib. in bills. the 6 lib.
the 100 lib. of silver yields, being silver,
and the 6 lib. the 300 of bills
yields, being payed in these bills: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
1 lib. silver, being worth 3 lib. in bills;
so the 6 lib. interest of the 100 lib. in
silver, would be equal to 18 lib. or the
interest of 900 lib. in bills.</p>

<p>And tho’ they were given out to be
repay’d in 20 years, at 5 per cent for
that time; or in 10 years, at 10 per
cent: they would not be equally valuable
with silver. the difference would
not be so great, as when given out for
45 years.</p>

<p>The advantage the nation would
have by the Dr’s proposal is; that tho’
these notes sell under the value of silver
money, and 500 lib. in notes were
only equal to a 100 lib. in silver; yet
the nation would have the same advantage
by that 500 lib. in notes, as
if an addition of a 100 lib. had been
made to the silver money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>So far as these bills fell under the value
of the silver money, so far would
exchange with other countries be
rais’d. and if goods did not keep their
price. (i. e.) if they did not sell for a
greater quantity of these bills, equal
to the difference betwixt them and silver:
goods exported would be undervalued,
and goods imported would
be overvalued, as has been explain’d
page 43 and 44 about exchange.</p>

<p>The landed-man would have no advantage
by this proposal, unless he
owed debt: for tho’ he received 50 lib.
of these bills, for the same quantity of
victual he was in use to receive, 10 lib.
silver money; yet that 50 lib. would
only be equal in value to 10 lib. of silver,
and purchase only the same quantity
of home or foreign goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The landed-man who had his rent
pay’d him in money, would be a great
loser. for by as much as these bills
were under the value of silver, he
would receive so much less than before.</p>

<p>The landed-man who owed debt,
would pay his debt with a less value
than was contracted for: but the creditor
would lose what the debtor
gain’d.</p>

<p>Dr. C. seems to be offended at my
meddling in this affair, having, as
he says, borrow’d what I know of
this subject from him. Two persons
may project the same thing, but so
far as I can judge, what I am to propose
is different from his, and what I
had form’d a scheme of several years
before I had seen any of his papers:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
which I can prove, if that were necessary,
by persons of worth I then show’d
it to. I have not, to my knowledge,
borrowed any thing from Dr. C. land
indeed is the value upon which he
founds his proposal, and ’tis upon land
that I found mine: if for that reason I
have incroached upon his proposal, the
bank of Scotland may be said to have
done the same: there were banks in
Europe long before the Dr’s proposal,
and books have been writ on the subject
before and since. the foundation
I go upon has been known so long as
money has been lent on land, and so
long as an heretable bond has been
equal to a quantity of land. whether
the structure he or I have built upon
that foundation be most safe, advantageous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and practicable, the parliament
can best judge.</p>

<p>Dr. C’s proposal is by anticipation,
to make land worth 50 or a 100
years purchase; and maintains that a
100 lib. to be payed yearly for 10, 50,
or a 100 years, is a valuable pledge for a
1000, 5000, or a 10000l. of bills: and
that these bills will be equal to silver-money.
if he can satisfie the nation
that his proposal is practicable, he does
a very great service, and gives a certain
advantage to the landed-man, without
wronging the money’d-man. I have
shown the reasons why I think the
proposal is not practicable; and that
notwithstanding any act of parliament
made to force these bills, they would
fall much under the value of silver. but
allowing they were at first equal to silver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
it is next to impossible that two
different species of money, shall continue
equal in value to one another.</p>

<p>Every thing receives a value from
its use, and the value is rated, according
to its quality, quantity and demand.
tho’ goods of different kinds
are equal in value now, yet they will
change their value, from any unequal
change in their quality, quantity, or
demand.</p>

<p>And as he leaves it to choice of
the debtor, to pay in silver-money or
bills; he confines the value of the bills,
to the value of the silver-money, but
cannot confine the value of the silver-money
to the value of the bills: so
that these bills must fall in value as silver-money
falls, and may fall lower:
silver may rise above the value of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
bills, but these bills cannot rise above
the value of silver.</p>

<p>What I shall propose, is to make
money of land equal to its value; and
that money to be equal in value to silver-money;
and not lyable to fall in
value as silver-money falls.</p>

<p>Any goods that have the qualities
necessary in money, may be made money
equal to their value. 5 ounces of
gold is equal in value to 20 lib. and
may be made money to that value. an
acre of land rented at 2 bolls of
victual, the victual at 8 lib. and land at
20 years purchase, is equal to 20 lib.
and may be made money equal to that
value, for it has all the qualities necessary
in money. but that acre of land
cannot be coin’d to the value of 50
lib. no more than the 5 ounces of gold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and tho’ the 5 ounces of gold, the 20l.
silver-money and the acre of land, be
now equal in value; yet they cannot
well continue so: for as I have shown
already, any disproportion’d change
in the quality, quantity, or in the demand
of either of them, will make the
same quantity of the one, equal to a
greater or lesser quantity of the others.
land is what in all appearance
will keep its value best, it may rise in
value, but cannot well fall: gold or silver
are lyable to many accidents,
whereby their value may lessen; but
cannot well rise in value.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The proposal with reasons for it.</i></p>
</div>


<p>To supply the nation with money,
it is humbly propos’d, that 40 commissioners
be appointed by parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
answerable to parliament for
their administration, and the administration
of the officers under them: the
nomination of these officers being left
to the commissioners.</p>

<p>That the commissioners have power
to coin notes: which notes to be received
in payments, where offer’d.</p>

<p>That a committee of parliament be
appointed to inspect the management,
and that none of the commissioners
be members.</p>

<p>That the commission and committee
meet twice a year at Whitsunday
and Martinmass; their meetings, to
begin 10 days before, and to continue
10 days after each term.</p>

<p>There are three ways humbly offer’d
to the parliament, for giving out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
these notes: they in their wisdom may
determine which will be most safe.</p>

<p>1. To authorize the commission to
lend notes on land security, the debt
not exceeding one half, or two thirds
of the value: and at the ordinary interest.</p>

<p>2. To give out the full price of land,
as it is valued, 20 years purchase more
or less, according to what it would
have given in silver-money, the commission
entring into possession of such
lands, by wadset granted to the commission
or assigneys; and redeemable
betwixt and the expiring of a term of
years.</p>

<p>3. To give the full price of land,
upon sale made of such lands, and disponed
to the commission or assigneys
irredeemably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>That any person shall have such
bonds, wadsets, or estates assigned or
dispon’d to them, upon paying in the
value to the commission.</p>

<p>That the commission don’t receive
other money than these notes.</p>

<p>That no person who has contracted
for these notes, shall be obliged
to receive silver or metal money.</p>

<p>That the commission have not
power to coin more than 50000 lib. at
a time, and that no more be coin’d so
long as there is 25000 lib. remaining
in the office.</p>

<p>That for a year and a half the commission
be limited to a certain sum, after
that time to have power to coin
what sums are demanded: unless restricted
by ensuing parliaments.</p>

<p>That these who desire to have money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
from the commission, give in a
note to the lawyers for the commission,
a month before the term, of what
sums they want, with the rights of the
lands they offer in pledge: and that
these who have notes to pay in to the
commission, give warning 10 days before
the term.</p>

<p>That the state of the commission,
the sum of notes coin’d, the debt and
credit, with the highest number of
the different notes, be publish’d every
term.</p>

<p>That any person who shall discover
2 notes of the same number, or of
a higher number than these publish’d,
shall have a 100 lib. reward.</p>

<p>That the under-officers be intrusted
with the sum of 20000 lib. to change
notes with; and that they attend the
whole year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>That any member of parliament
may inspect the state of the commission.</p>

<p>That no notes be coined, money
lent, or rights assigned by the commission,
but at the terms of Whitsunday
and Martinmass: and in presence of at
least 20 commissioners, and one third
of the committee.</p>

<p>That the revenue of the commission,
over what pays the charges, and
what part the parliament thinks
needful to make good any losses may
happen to the commission, be applyed
by way of drawback, for encouraging
the export, and manufacture
of the nation.</p>

<p>That paper-money do not rise
more than 10 per cent above silver-money;
so that he who contracts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
pay in paper, may know what he is
to pay in case he cannot get paper-money.</p>

<p>The parliament may enter into a
resolve, that the next sessions of this
or the next ensuing parliament, the
state of the commission be taken into
consideration, preferable to all other
business: and if found hurtful to the
country, the parliament may discharge
any more notes to be given
out, and order what notes are then
out to be called in.</p>

<p>That after 3 months from the
date of the act, Scots and foreign money
be reduced to the English standard.
the English crown to 60 pence,
and the other money in proportion
to its value of silver. the 40 pence to
38 pence, the new mark to 13 pence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
1/2, the old mark to its weight, the ducatdowns
to 68 pence, dollars to
their weight. guineas not to pass 22 sh.</p>

<p>That after 4 months no Scots money,
(except what shall be coined after
the act) nor any foreign money
except the English money, be received
in any payments, or be sold as bullion
but at the mint.</p>

<p>That for what old money or bullion
is brought to the mint, the mint
return to the full value in new money
of 12 pence, 6 pence, and 3
pence pieces; of eleven deniers fine,
the 12 pence of 3 drops 3 grains
weight, the other pieces to weigh in
proportion: the expence of coinage
to be payed out of the funds appropriated
to that use.</p>

<p>That for 3 months, after the act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
the new money pass for 13 pence,
6 pence half-penny, and 3 pence 1/4.</p>

<p>That after 3 months, bullion and
wrought plate be of eleven deniers
fine, and 5 sh. and 2 d. the ounce of
silver, gold not to pass 4 lib.</p>

<p>The paper-money proposed will
be equal in value to silver, for it will
have a value of land pledg’d equal to
the same sum of silver-money that
it is given out for. if any losses should
happen, one 4th of the revenue of
the commission, will in all appearance
be more than sufficient to make
them good.</p>

<p>This paper-money will not fall in
value as silver-money has fallen, or
may fall: goods or money fall in value,
if the increase in quantity, or if
the demand lessens. but the commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
giving out what sums are demanded,
and taking back what sums are
offered to be returned; this paper-money
will be keep its value, and
there will always be as much money
as there is occasion, or imployment
for, and no more.</p>

<p>If a contract for paper-money could
be satisfied by paying the same quantity
of silver money, then that paper-money
could not rise above the value
of silver, and would fall with it. but
as the paper money is a different
species from silver, so it will not be
lyable to any of the changes silver
money is lyable to.</p>

<p>Tho’ the parliament could give
silver money to the people, in as
great quantity as there were occasion:
the parliament could not justly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
know what sum would serve the
country, for the demand changes. if
the quantity of money is less than
the demand, the landed man is wronged:
for a 100 lib. then being more
valuable, will buy a greater quantity
of the landed mans goods. if the
quantity of money is greater than the
demand, the money’d-man is wronged,
for a 100 lib. then is not so valuable,
so will not buy the same quantity
of goods a 100 lib. bought before.</p>

<p>If the commission do not give out
money when it is demanded, where
good security is offer’d; ’tis a hardship
on the person who is refused, and
a loss to the country: for few if any
borrow money to keep by them; and
if employ’d it brings a profit to the
nation, tho’ the employer loses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>If the commission did not take back
what sums were offer’d to be return’d,
it were a hardship on the money’d
man, who has a sum payed him, and
does not know how to employ it; and
the quantity being greater than the demand
for it, would fall in value.</p>

<p>After the method propos’d, the
quantity being always equal to the demand
for it, it will keep its value, and
buy the same quantity of goods 50
years hence, as now: unless the goods
alter in their value, from any change
in their quantity, or in the demand for
them.</p>

<p>Suppose this commission had been
establisht 200 years ago, land then at
14 years purchase, money at 10 per
cent, victual at 8 shil. and 4 pence the
chalder, and paper money to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
given out upon land; 8 shil. and 4
pence of that paper money, would
now have been equal to a chalder of
victual, and to 8 lib. 6 sh. and 4 pence
silver-money: because silver-money
having increas’d in quantity, more
than the demand; and having been alter’d
in the denomination, has fallen
to one 20th of the value it had then.
nor would the landed-man have receiv’d
less for his victual, than now;
for that paper-money would have
bought him 20 times the quantity of
goods, silver-money will buy.</p>

<p>Land has a more certain value than
other goods, for it does not encrease
in quantity, all other goods may. the
uses of goods may be discharged, or by
custom be taken from them, and given
to other goods: the use of bread may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
be taken from oats, and wholly given
to wheat: the use of money may be
taken from silver, and given to land:
the use of plate, and the other uses of
silver as a metal, may be taken from
silver, and given to some other metal,
or some mixture that may be more fitted
for these uses. in any of these cases,
these goods lose a part of their value,
proportion’d to the uses are taken from
them: but land cannot lose any of its
uses. for as every thing is produced by
land, so the land must keep its value,
because it can be turn’d to produce
the goods that are in use. if wheat is
more us’d, and oats less, as the land
can produce both, it will be turn’d to
produce what is most used, because
most valuable.</p>

<p>This money will not receive any additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
value from being used as money,
so the receiver will be certain he
can be no loser, tho’ after a term of
years the use of money is taken from
it. the land will receive an additional
value, from being used as the pledge
upon which the money is issued;
and that additional value would be
greater than what silver received: because,
tho’ land be used as the pledge
to issue out money upon, yet none of
its other uses would be taken from it:
silver cannot be us’d as money and
plate at the same time. but as land is
in greater quantity than there will be
occasion for to give out money upon;
so the additional value it receives, will
not be near so great as that silver-money
has receiv’d.</p>

<p>Suppose the additional value land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
received were one 4th, land now at 20
years purchase, would then be at 25
years purchase. if the parliament call’d
in the paper money, he who had paper
money could be no loser by it,
tho’ the land lost the additional value;
for no more of it is given out than the
value of the land abstract from its use
as money. whereas if silver was no
more used as money, he who had silver,
would lose a half, or 2 thirds; silver
falling then to its value as a metal.</p>

<p>So that this paper money propos’d,
having a better value than silver; and
receiving no addition to its value, from
being used as money; and not being
lyable to any change in its value,
the quantity and demand encreasing
and decreasing together: it is so far
more qualified to be the measure by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
which goods are valued, the value by
which goods are exchanged, and in
which contracts are made payable.</p>

<p>The other qualities necessary in
money, are,</p>

<p>1. Easy of delivery.</p>

<p>2. Of the same value in one place to
what it is in another.</p>

<p>3. To be kept without loss or expence.</p>

<p>4. To be divided without loss.</p>

<p>5. To be capable of a stamp.</p>

<p>Paper money has these qualities in
a greater degree than silver.</p>

<p>1. It is easier of delivery: 500 lib.
in paper may be payed in less time,
than 5 lib. in silver.</p>

<p>2. It is nearer the value in one place
to what it is in another, being of easier
carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>3. It can be easier kept; taking up
less room. and without loss; because
it may be exchanged at the office. the
consumption of paper is not of so
much value as the consumption of silver:
the consumption of the paper is
a loss to the office, the consumption
of silver is a loss to the owner.</p>

<p>4. It can be divided without loss:
because it may be changed for lesser
notes at the office.</p>

<p>5. It is capable of a stamp, and less
liable to be counterfeit.</p>

<p>The practice of most trading nations
confirms, that paper is more qualified
for the use of money, than silver;
providing it hath a value. in Holland
silver is pledg’d, and paper is used
as money. that land pledg’d is a better
value than silver pledg’d, is evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
from what has been said. in England,
before the bank was set up, gold-smiths
notes were received in payments
preferable to gold or silver:
which shows that paper money had all
the qualities necessary in money, so
much more than gold or silver, as to
equal the danger of a gold-smith’s
breaking, of which there were many
examples. Mr. Lock, pag. 7th on interest
of money, says, that one gold-smith’s
credit (being usually a note
under one of his servants hands) went
for above eleven hundred thousand
pounds at a time.</p>

<p>The notes of the bank in Scotland
went, tho’ there was no money in the
bank, and tho’ their acceptance was
voluntary. the security for the paper
propos’d will be as good, the administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
may be more safe and satisfactory
than that bank, or any other private
bank; because it is more public,
and the commission has not any share
of the profits. besides it will not be
liable to the hazard banks are liable to,
from the sale of shares.</p>

<p>And it seems strange that the administration
of such a commission should
be doubted, when the parliament has
the nomination of the managers;
when the managers are to be accountable
to the parliament; when the trust
is to be so small, for more notes cannot
be coin’d so long as 25000 lib. is in the
office; a committee of parliament is to
be appointed to inspect the management,
the books are to be open to the
inspection of any member of parliament,
and the state of the commission
is to be published in print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>Since the notes of the bank went
upon a voluntary acceptance, tho’
there was no money in bank; ’tis reasonable
to think the paper money propos’d
will at least have the same currency:
being current by law does not
make it less valuable. he who took
bank notes, could not be sure the bank
would be in a condition to give money
for them; and the person he was
to pay money to, might refuse them:
so he was more uncertain, than if they
had been current by law.</p>

<p>The silver money being to fall betwixt
8 and 9 per cent in 3 months,
it is not to be suppos’d that silver will
be prefer’d to paper money; since
the notes of the bank, which is paper
upon the same fund, went at the ordinary
interest: and tho’ the receiver
was not certain of the money at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
time it was promised, or that the person
he was owing to would receive it.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that paper went
because silver could be got for it when
demanded, or at a certain time.</p>

<p>That was very reasonable, but
would not be so in this case: the security
pledg’d for that paper money, was
silver. the security pledg’d for this paper
money, is land. this money has no
relation to gold or silver, more than
to other goods. and it were more extravagant
to say, I won’t take a 100 lib.
of such paper money for the goods I
sell, because I am not sure if 6 months
hence it will buy me such a quantity
of silver; for silver may grow dearer:
as it would be to say now, I won’t take
a 100 lib. in silver for the goods I sell;
because I am not sure if 6 months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
hence, it will buy me such a quantity
of wine, for wine may grow dearer.</p>

<p>4 Crowns won’t buy a guinea, tho’
they were coin’d for the same value;
nor won’t buy the 10th part of goods
4 crowns bought 200 years ago, yet
silver is received as a value, and contracted
for, tho’ its value lessens every
year, and tho’ ’tis not perhaps worth
above a third of what ’tis given or contracted
for, abstracted from the use of
money. this paper propos’d will not
only keep its value; the encrease of
the quantity depending on the demand,
and the quantity decreasing as
the demand decreases: but likewise
the land pledg’d is as valuable as the
paper given out, abstract from its use
as money, and encreases in value.</p>

<p>The objection may be made against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
silver money, and with good reason;
for it falls faster in its value than other
goods, and may soon be reduced to its
value as a metal.</p>

<p>The paper money propos’d is equal
to its self; but to continue equal to
such a quantity of any other goods, is
to have a quality that no goods can
have: for that depends on the changes
in these other goods. it has a better and
more certain value than silver money,
and all the other qualities necessary in
money in a much greater degree, with
other qualities that silver has not, and
is more capable of being made money
than any thing yet known. land is
what is most valuable, and what encreases
in value more than other
goods; so the paper money issued
from it, will in all appearance not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
keep equal to other goods, but rise
above them.</p>

<p>Because of the extraordinary scarcity
of silver in Scotland, and the inclination
people have to it, from its
having been long used as money; it
may be necessary to restrict its price to
5 sh. and 2 pence the ounce: but it
will soon fall from that value of paper,
if it come in greater quantity into Europe,
than is exported or consum’d.</p>

<p>Suppose an island belonging to one
man, the number of tenents a 100,
each tenent 10 in family, in all a
1000; by these the island is labour’d,
part to the product of corns, the rest
for pasturage: besides the tenents and
their families, there are 300 poor or
idle, who live by charity. there is no
money, but rents are paid in kind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
if one tenent has more of one product,
and less of another than his family
has occasion for, he barters with
his neighbour.</p>

<p>The people of this island know nothing
of manufacture; the island being
plentiful, furnishes enough for their
consumption, and an overplus which
they exchange on the continent for
cloaths, and what other goods they
want: but as that overplus is only sufficient
to make a return of such a quantity
of goods as they consume yearly,
so they have no magazines of their
own or foreign goods to serve them in
bad years, nor no magazines of arms,
ammunition, &amp;c. for their defence.</p>

<p>’Tis propos’d to the proprietor, that
if a money were establish’d to pay the
wages of labour, the 300 poor might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
be imployed in manufacturing such
goods as before were exported in product;
and as the 1000 that labour the
ground were idle one half of their
time, they might be imployed so as
their additional labour would be equal
to that of 500 more, which would lessen
their import by providing them
with a part of such goods as before
they brought from the continent, and
raise their export to 3 or 4 times the
value it had: the return of which would
furnish them with greater quantities
of foreign goods than they wanted
for consumption, which might be laid
up in magazines.</p>

<p>The money propos’d is after this
manner. the proprietor to coin pieces
of paper figured number 1, number 2,
and so on; number 4 to be equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
a certain measure of corn. the poor
and other labourers would be satisfied
to take number 4 for the wages of a
day’s labour, providing it be so contriv’d
that number 4 purchase them
the measure of corn; for as that corn
can be barter’d with other goods, so
number 4 would purchase an equal
value of any other goods.</p>

<p>To make number 4 equal to that
measure of corn, the proprietor calls
his tenents together; tells them for the
future, he will have his rent payed in
paper, so renews their leases, and where
a 100 measures of corn was payed,
they oblige themselves to pay him
number 400. the other kinds the proprietor
was payed in are valued, according
to the value they had in barter
with corn; and leases made for paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>The proprietor coins paper to the
value of a year’s rent, imploys such as
are willing to work, and gives them paper-money
as the price of their labour.
the tenent gives corn or any other
goods he has to the labourers for paper-money,
and the proprietor receives
it for his rent. but as the consumption
of the labouring man may be suppos’d
to be only equal to number 2; so the
tenents cannot get the whole sum issued
by the proprietor, and consequently
not enough to pay their rent. if this
were not remedied, the labouring
men being masters of the remaining
part of the paper, and having no occasion
for more goods from the tenents,
might raise the value of the paper. to
prevent this, the proprietor coins a
greater quantity, which brings a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of the poor and idle of the continent to
the island, and occasions a greater consumption,
whereby the tenents are
able to pay their rent in paper as contracted
for. the addition to the people
is an advantage to the island; for it adds
to the power of the island, and their
labour is worth double what they
consume.</p>

<p>This money tho’ it has no value
but what the proprietor gives it, by
receiving it in payments of his rent;
yet it will be esteem’d equal to the product
payed before.</p>

<p>If the proprietor would give it a
value in land, computing after this
manner: an acre of land pays number
100, at 20 years purchase worth number
2000. and dispone the property
of land for paper at that value; who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
would not be satisfied to receive or
contract for that money, since it not
only bought the product, but the property
of land at a reasonable price?</p>

<p>Money is not the value for which
goods are exchanged, but the value by
which they are exchanged: the use of
money is to buy goods, and silver while
money is of no other use.</p>

<p>Tho’ silver were our product, yet it
is not so proper to be made money
as land. land is what produces every
thing, silver is only the product. land
does not increase or decrease in quantity,
silver or any other product may.
so land is more certain in its value
than silver, or any other goods.</p>

<p>Land is capable of improvement,
and the demand for it may be greater;
so it may be more valuable. silver cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
be suppos’d to be apply’d to any
other uses, than it is now apply’d to;
or that the demand will encrease more
than the quantity.</p>

<p>Land cannot lose any of its uses, so
will not be less valuable; silver may
lose the use of money it is now apply’d
to, so be reduc’d to its value as a metal.</p>

<p>It may likewise lose a part of its
uses as a metal, these uses being supply’d
by other goods: so loses a part of
its value as a metal. but nothing can
supply the uses of land.</p>

<p>Land may be convey’d by paper,
and thereby has the other qualities
necessary in money, in a greater degree
than silver.</p>

<p>Land has other qualities fitting it
for the use of money, that silver has
not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Land apply’d to the use of money,
does not lose any of the other uses it
is apply’d to: silver cannot serve the
use of money, and any of its other uses
as a metal.</p>

<p>Trade and money depend mutually
on one another; when trade decays,
money lessens; and when money lessens,
trade decays. power and wealth
consists in numbers of people, and magazines
of home and foreign goods;
these depend on trade, and trade on
money. so while trade and money
may be effected directly and consequentially;
that which is hurtful to either,
must be so to both, power and
wealth will be precarious.</p>

<p>If a money is establish’d that has no
intrinsick value, and its extrinsick value
to be such, as it will not be exported;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
nor will not be less than the demand
for it within the country: wealth
and power will be attained, and be less
precarious. money not being liable to
be lessen’d directly, nor consequentially;
and trade not liable to decay consequentially.
so the power and wealth
of that country will only be precarious,
from what may be directly hurtful
to trade.</p>

<p>The paper money propos’d being
always equal in quantity to the demand,
the people will be employ’d,
the country improv’d, manufacture
advanc’d, trade domestick and foreign
will be carried on, and wealth and
power attained. and not being liable
to be exported, the people will not be
set idle, &amp;c. and wealth and power
will be less precarious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>From whence it is evident, that
land is more qualified for the use of
money than silver; and preferable for
that use tho’ silver were the product of
Scotland: being more certain in its value,
and having the qualities necessary
in money, in a greater degree: with other
qualities that silver has not; so
more capable of being the general
measure by which goods are valued,
the value by which goods are exchanged,
and in which contracts are taken.</p>

<p>If 2000 lib. of paper money, is equal
to the property of land worth
2000 lib. in silver; then that 2000 lib.
of paper money, is equal to 2000 lib.
of silver.</p>

<p>What buys land, will buy every
thing the land produces; and what
buys the product of land, will buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
all other goods whether home or foreign.
if wine is brought from France,
the merchant designs to lay out his
money on goods, at interest, or on
land: the commission does not receive
silver money, so he cannot have a
bond from the commission, unless he
give the value in paper; and many of
the landed men won’t take silver for
their goods or lands, having occasion
for paper to pay the commission. so
the merchant will choose to sell his
wines for paper money, because it will
purchase him goods, bonds or lands
where silver money will, being equally
valuable: and in cases where silver
money will not.</p>

<p>And this is supposing silver were
equally qualified for the use of money,
as land is. but as silver is an uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
value, and is given for much more
than its value as a metal; and has not
all the qualities necessary in money,
nor in so great a degree as paper money:
so paper money will for these other
reasons be prefer’d to silver.</p>

<p>Some object that a paper money
tho’ upon a good fund, and current in
the country; yet will not be valued
abroad, equal to what it were in Scotland.</p>

<p>The goods of Scotland will always
be valued abroad, equal to goods
of the same kind and goodness; and
that money tho’ of paper, which buys
goods in Scotland, will buy goods or
money in other places. if a 1000 lib.
in serges, linen cloth, &amp;c. be worth
abroad all charges payed 1300 lib. the
merchant who exports such goods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
will give a bill for that money at the
par, having 1300 lib. for what cost
him a 1000.</p>

<p>When a nation establishes a money,
if the money they set up, have a
value equal to what it is made money
for, and all the other qualities necessary
in money; they ought to have no
regard what value it will have in other
countries. on the contrair, as
every country endeavours by laws to
preserve their money, if that people
can contrive a money that will not be
valued abroad; they will do what other
countries have by laws endeavour’d
in vain.</p>

<p>No nation keeps to silver because
it is used in other countries, it is because
they can find nothing so safe
and convenient. trade betwixt nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
is carried on by exchange of goods,
and if one merchant sends out goods
of a less value, than he brings home;
he has money furnish’d him abroad
by another who brings home for a
less value than he sent out: if there is
no money due abroad, then the merchant
who designed to import for a
greater value than he exported, is restricted;
and can only import equal
to his export, which is all the many
laws to regulate trade have been endeavouring.</p>

<p>It is objected that we are under a
necessity of having goods from countries
who will take none of ours.
France does not allow money to be
exported, nor any ship to import
goods, unless French goods are exported
from the same port, to the value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the goods which were imported. by
our law we are forbid to export money.
but as I don’t think the example
of nations a good answer, I shall endeavour
to give a better. suppose our
money is not valued abroad, and we
have occasion for goods from Denmark,
who takes none of ours. these
goods being necessary here, will be
valued higher than other goods that
are not so necessary; and the value of
Scots goods sold in other countries,
will be carried to Denmark, in such
goods as will sell there, or in foreign
money, and these necessary goods be
brought home: because the trader
makes a greater profit by them, than
by such goods as could have been imported
from that country, where the
goods exported were sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>But as this addition to the money
will employ the people who are now
idle, and these now employ’d to more
advantage: so the product will be encreas’d,
and manufacture advanc’d. if
the consumption of the nation continues
as now, the export will be greater,
and a ballance due to us: and as the
exchange depends on the ballance, so
paper money here, will be equal to a
greater quantity of silver money abroad.</p>

<p>Suppose the yearly value of Scotland
a million and a half, the yearly
value of England 40 millions; the value
of Scotland, is only about one 28th
part of the value of England. yet the
quantity and quality of the lands, and
the numbers of people consider’d;
Scotland will be at least as 1 to 6. and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
if there was money to employ the
people, we would be as one to 6; for
we have advantages peculiar to us,
that do more than equal the Plantation
and East-India trades.</p>

<p>England is not improv’d so far as it
might be, by a greater quantity of money.
we may have money equal to the
demand, by applying our land to that
use. so our country may be improv’d
above the proportion of one to 6. but
if the propos’d addition to our money,
improved the country only so as to
bear a proportion with England of
one to 13, our yearly value would be
3 millions: and our consumption not
being half what the same number of
people consume in England; if the
consumption continued as now, the
ballance due to Scotland would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
greater, than the ballance due to England.</p>

<p>This addition to our yearly value
may be thought by some people, a
supposition that’s extravagant, but I
desire these people will consider what
consequences the plenty of money
has had in other places. as the money
of England has increas’d, the yearly
value has increas’d; and as the money
has decreas’d, the yearly value has decreas’d.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt but the paper-money
propos’d being given out equal to the
demand, would bring the yearly value
of Scotland to 3 millions, tho’ the
fishing and other branches of foreign
trade (which might be improv’d to
great advantage) were neglected. but
suppose the yearly value increas’d only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
half a million, of which a 4th spent in
a greater consumption of the product
and manufacture of the country, a
4th in the greater consumption of foreign
goods and expence abroad, a 4th
laid up in magazines of foreign goods,
a 4th would still be due of ballance
and brought home in silver.</p>

<p>If the consumption and expence
increas’d equal to, or beyond the improvement;
as the paper-money could
not be exported, so the people would
not be set idle, nor the manufacture decay:
that money being like an estate
intail’d. we might continue to consume
equal to the yearly value, but
could not lessen the yearly value, nor
be poorer if we would.</p>

<p>If a greater value of goods was imported
than was exported, and credit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
given for the ballance; foreigners to
pay themselves, would send a lesser
value of goods the year after. but such
restrictions may be put on the consumption
of our own and foreign
goods, as may make a ballance due.</p>

<p>The revenue of the commission
will be a great help toward the advancing
our trade in its infancy: what encourages
the export of goods, encourages
the manufacture of them; and
that money given as a draw-back, will
not only encourage the export and
manufacture; but likewise regain the
reputation our goods have lost, and
give them a better reputation than
the goods of other nations.</p>

<p>The draw-back ought not to be
given to all goods, but to such as do not
yield a reasonable profit abroad, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
upon condition they are found sufficient.</p>

<p>The seal of the office of draw-back
ought to be apply’d to these goods
that receive the draw-back; and these
intrusted with the draw-back, should
give security to pay the price of such
goods, with all charges, if found insufficient.</p>

<p>When manufacture and trade prospers,
the landed man’s rent is well
payed, and increases: when they decay,
his rent is ill pay’d, and decreases.
a draw-back is so effectual a way to
encourage and promote manufacture
and trade; that it were the landed
men’s interest to tax themselves, rather
than a draw-back should not be
given, where it is necessary.</p>

<p>A draw-back is more necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
here than in other countries, for we
do not manufacture so well as other
nations: we are not able to sell for
the same profit, our stocks being much
smaller; and the goods of other nations
will be preferr’d to ours, because
our goods are suspected.</p>

<p>Some object that this proposal is
new, and has not been practis’d in
any nation.</p>

<p>The example of another nation
ought not to determine us, to follow
the same measures, without examining
whether that nation was the better
or the worse by such measures; and
whether our circumstances and theirs
don’t differ so, as to make that hurtful
or ineffectual to us, which was of
advantage to them. on the other hand,
it is no argument against any thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
propos’d for the general good, to say
it is new, and what has not been
practis’d.</p>

<p>When any thing propos’d has been
already practis’d by other nations, ’tis
a presumption in favours of such a
proposal; and it’s a presumption against
it, if it has been refused: but a
wise nation ought not to be determined
by example, to follow or refuse
without examining.</p>

<p>This proposal has not been refus’d.
the essential part is now practis’d
in France, for paper is current by
law: and tho’ after a manner that in
all appearance ought to have hindred
its currency, yet I’m inform’d foreign
bills are bought with paper money,
the same as with silver or gold.</p>

<p>The example of nations in relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
to money would be a very uncertain
rule. for as has been said page 70,
opposite measures have been us’d in
some countries to what have been
used in others, and contrary measures
have been used in the same countries
to what was used immediately before,
not because of any difference in their
circumstances, but from the opinion,
that since the method used had not
the effect design’d, a contrary would;
and there are good reasons to think
that the nature of money is not yet
rightly understood.</p>

<p>Any other objections that I have
yet heard against this proposal, are
such as may be fully answered, and so
far as I can see into it, with all the
application I have been capable of,
I cannot find any objection but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
may be fully answer’d; nor any difficulty
in the execution, but what
may be removed: if there is any fallacy
in the positions I lay down, or
any wrong consequences drawn from
these positions, I have not been able
to discover them.</p>

<p><i>The low condition this country is reduced to, notwithstanding
its natural advantages.</i></p>


<p>The natural advantages the Dutch
have for trade, are, their situation at
the mouths of the rivers of Germany,
and being near the bulky trade.</p>

<p>Their natural disadvantages are,
smallness of territory, barrenness of
soil, producing little but what’s forc’d;
want of mines; long winters; unwholsome
air; marishy, so oblig’d to
great expence for foundation to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
buildings, in making and keeping up
the high-ways, and in draining the
country yearly; a dangerous coast;
difficult entry to their rivers; the sea
to defend against on one side, and
powerful neighbours on the other;
and heavy taxes, the consequence of
these other disadvantages.</p>

<p>Yet they have so improv’d their
few advantages, that they are become
a rich and powerful people. what has
contributed to their riches and power,
was the early protection and favour
the government gave to trade; the
liberty which was given to people of
different religions; the freedom of
trade allowed to strangers; the example
of their rulers in oeconomy;
but chiefly the neglect of trade in other
countries, particularly in Spain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
who forced the people and trade of
Flanders to Holland.</p>

<p>Scotland has by nature many advantages
for trade; a large territory;
of easie defence; plenty of people; a
wholsome air; mines; a proper situation
for the eastern and western trades;
near the bulky trade; a safe coast;
rivers of easie entry; the seas and rivers
stockt with fish.</p>

<p>But numbers of people, the greatest
riches of other nations, are a burden
to us; the land is not improv’d,
the product is not manufactur’d; the
fishing and other advantages for foreign
trade are neglected: and the reason
generally given is, that laziness and
want of honesty are natural to us.</p>

<p>If want of honesty and laziness
were natural, they would be so to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
mankind; or if peculiar to a people,
this would be so to the Dutch rather
than to us: the air of Holland is grosser
which inclines to laziness; and the
country not producing wherewith to
maintain the inhabitants, would force
them to rob or cheat their neighbours,
or one another. but it is more reasonable
to think laziness and want of
honesty are vices, the consequences
of poverty; and poverty the consequence
of a faulty administration. if
the same measures had been taken in
Scotland for encouraging trade, as
was taken in Holland, we had been a
more powerful and richer nation than
Holland. if Spain, France and Britain,
or any one of them had apply’d to
trade, as early, and upon the same
measures Holland did; Holland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
would not have been inhabited. but by
their early application, and the wrong
measures of other countries, they
have got such great magazines of
what’s necessary for their maintenance
and defence; of rich commodities to
sell to other nations, of materials for
shipping, &amp;c. and such a quantity of
silver, esteem’d above its value as a
metal by being used as money: that
in all appearance so long as silver is
used as money, the great quantity
they have of it, with their great oeconomy,
enabling them to under-sell
other nations; they will maintain the
rank they hold in trade, and consequently
in power; notwithstanding
their natural disadvantages, the present
application, and natural advantages
of other nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>This country is more capable of an
extended trade than any other country
of Europe, yet it is reduc’d to a
very low state. trade is ruin’d; the national
stock is wasted; the people forsake
the country; the rents of land
are unpay’d; houses in towns, and
farms in the country are thrown upon
the owners hands; the creditor cannot
have the interest of his money
to live upon; and the debitor’s person
and estate are expos’d to the law.</p>

<p>The landed man, by having engaged
his person and estate for the
payment of a species, which is not in
his power to perform; and having no
alternative: by the law his person is
at the mercy of the creditor, and his
estate to be sold for so much of that
species as it will yield. if 2 or 3 money’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
men call in their money, with
a design to force their debitors to part
with their estates, at what prices they
please to impose: they may bring the
price of land to 15 or 10 years purchase.
for they would not take bonds
in payment, and few or none would
be in a condition to buy with money.</p>

<p>If victual should prove scarce, as
we have not goods or money for any
value to send out for corns; so only
a part of the people could be maintained:
the better part would have
bread, but the more necessary part,
the labouring men, would be forc’d
to leave the country, or to starve in it.
nor would they fare better in England;
for as the scarcity of money
has set idle many of the people of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
England, so there are more already
than there is employment for: and our
people, at least many of them, would
meet the same fate they had endeavoured
to evite.</p>

<p>The landed men would want people
to labour the ground; they would
perhaps get food and cloathing for
themselves and families, but these
they were owing to, in all appearance,
would get nothing: for the case being
general, and the landed men the
stronger party; they would not suffer
their liberty and estates to be taken
from them. but tho’ the law could be
put in execution, and the estates of the
landed men were put to sale; as there
would be few purchasers, the price of
land would fall very low. suppose the
land were sold or given among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
creditors for 15 years purchase, or
less; it would be sold for more than it
were worth, for they would not find
people to labour it: so many would
be sufferers, and none gainers.</p>

<p>If neither of these cases happen;
yet this country cannot well subsist in
the condition ’tis in: if this opportunity
is neglected, if wrong or ineffectual
measures are taken, in all
appearance we will be in confusion
before we have another opportunity.</p>

<p>To raise or allay the money, to
coin the plate, or regulate trade, are
offer’d as measures to supply the want
of money: and ’tis thought any one
of them will bring us out of our difficulties.
when they come to be examin’d,
raising or allaying the money
will be found no help but a hurt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the country, whatever our circumstances
are. the others may prove ineffectual.</p>

<p>’Tis thought our import and expence
abroad this last year exceeded
our export by a very considerable sum,
so to make the ballance equal we must
not only retrench equal to the money
which was sent out last year; but like-ways
so much more as the want of that
money, and of the addition the bank
made to our money may have lessen’d
the yearly value. so tho’ ’tis possible
that coining the plate and regulating
trade may bring the ballance to our
side, yet ’tis to be fear’d the consequences
will show that it is not very
practicable; for that and other reasons
already given. however they may assist,
but in regulating our import, regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
ought to be had that the sale of
our goods abroad be no way hindred,
for if that is not taken care of, we shall
lose more for want of a market, than
we shall save by importing less. and
tho’ all necessary care be taken, yet
the assistance may reasonably be expected
from these measures, will not
relieve us; they may keep us lingring
in the state we are, expos’d to confusion
at home, and to insults from abroad.</p>

<p>Most people think scarcity of money
is only the consequence of a ballance
due; but ’tis the cause as well
as the consequence, and the effectual
way to bring the ballance to our side,
is to add to the money.</p>

<p>Our poor have been computed
200000, our people were then more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
than now, but our poor may be as
many as then; suppose only 100000,
and by the addition to our money
50000 of them were imployed, and
only for one half of the year, their
labour to be payed 3 pence, and
worth 3 pence more to the imployer,
their consumption a penny more
than now: the yearly value of the nation
would be increas’d by such labour
189583 lib. 6 sh. and 8 pence.</p>

<p>If the country people about Perth
and Stirling, have to the value of
20000 l. of linen, serges, and other
manufacture more than is bought up;
tho’ these goods exported will yield
20 or 30 per cent. profit, yet the owners
can’t export them, the goods being
in so many different hands, and not
having correspondents abroad to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
whom they could trust the sale of
them. A. B. and C. are satisfied for
that profit to take the trouble and hazard
of exporting them, but money
being scarce they cannot get any to
borrow, tho’ their security be good;
nor cannot well have credit for the
goods from so many different people
they are strangers to. if they could
have credit for them, yet these country
people must be idle till A. B. and
C. pay them out of their returns
from abroad. so for want of money
to exchange by, goods fall in value,
and manufacture decays.</p>

<p>It cannot well be known what sum
will serve the occasions of the nation,
for as manufacture and trade advance,
the demand for money will increase;
but the many poor we have always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
had, is a great presumption we have
never had money enough.</p>

<p>England has been computed to have
had 14 millions in gold and silver,
and at the same time had paper-money
for a great sum; yet England
never had money enough to imploy
the people: 50 million would not
improve England so far as it is capable
of improvement. if all the people were
then imployed and to the best advantage,
more money would bring more
people from other countries. the province
of Holland by a great quantity
of money, and numbers of people
the consequence of much money, is
able to bear a share in the wars of
Europe, equal to many times the same
number of acres of better land in
England; yet Holland has not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
advantages for trade that England
has. so that country that can have money
equal to the demand, will be more
powerful than any other country
with the same advantages, whose money
is less than the demand.</p>

<p>If money were given to a people
in greater quantity than there was a
demand for, money would fall in its
value; but if only given equal to the
demand, it will not fall in value.</p>

<p>At present perhaps 3 or 400000
lib. is more than there is a demand
for; but as trade and manufacture increase,
the demand for money will be
greater.</p>

<p>What I have propos’d to supply
the country with money, may be reduc’d
to this. if an estate of a 100 l.
rent is worth 2000 l. in silver-money,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
and this estate can be convey’d
by paper, and this paper be capable
of being divided; then that estate
may be made current money for 2000
lib. and any person who receives such
paper money, receives a value equal
to the same sum of silver money, as silver
is valued now. if it is coin’d for 15
years purchase, then that paper-money
will be more valuable than silver,
for 1500 lib. in that paper will purchase
land worth 2000 lib. silver-money.
if it is coin’d for 25 years purchase,
then that paper money will not
be so valuable as silver, for 2000 lib.
in silver will buy as much land as 2500
lib. in paper.</p>

<p>Since it is very practicable to make
land money, it would be contrary to
reason to limit the industry of the people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
by making it depend on a species
that is not in our power, but in the
power of our enemies; when we have
a species of our own every way more
qualified.</p>

<p>And considering the state of this
country from the great scarcity of
money; that the value of lands fall,
rents are unpayed, farms are thrown
upon the master’s hand, and the debitor’s
person and estate expos’d to the
law, being engag’d to pay a species
of which there is scarce any in the
nation.</p>

<p>2. The hazard the money’d man
is in from the uncertainty of the value
of money, and the danger of confusion,
in which case the money’d
man may lose all.</p>

<p>3. The low state of trade, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
many of the people who depended
on trade and liv’d well, are starving or
forc’d abroad.</p>

<p>4. That the other degrees of the
people suffer in proportion.</p>

<p>5. That the nation in this condition
may run into confusion, and
is expos’d to its enemies.</p>

<p>Considering the benefit the nation
will have by this addition to the money;
that the land will be improv’d,
so be more valuable, rents be well
payed, and that debitors by paying a
value equal to what is contracted for,
may free their persons and estates
from the danger they are now exposed
to.</p>

<p>2. That the money’d man will receive
punctual payment, in a money
of a more certain value than silver or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
any other goods, and be in no danger
of confusion.</p>

<p>3. That trade will flourish, and
these who depend on it be encouraged.</p>

<p>4. That the condition of the other
degrees of the people will be better’d.</p>

<p>5. That the nation will be able to
maintain itself in order, and resist its
enemies.</p>

<p>These reasons considered, the question
then will be, whether we will
improve the country as much as it is
capable, without being at any expence
for a measure of trade, or continue as
we are in hopes of silver from other
nations.</p>

<p>It will be a great advantage to this
nation, that by the register we are capable
of putting this proposal in execution,
and enjoying the benefit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
it; when other nations, tho’ they resolv’d
upon it, would for some years
be incapable of it. tho’ for the general
good of Europe it were to be wish’d
England were as capable of it as we
are.</p>

<p>I have not had time to put my
thoughts in that order they ought to
have been, and am forc’d to leave
out answers I design’d to have given
to some objections I have heard made
against this proposal; but if the parliament
think good to enter upon the
consideration of it, I don’t doubt
but it may be made appear to be of
great and certain advantage; that it
cannot possibly be any way hurtful
to the country in general, and that it
may be so ordered, as not to be hurtful
to any person, but on the contrair.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
